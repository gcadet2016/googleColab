2	12	1	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	This is a gated community called "Buttonwood Bay Condominiums" at milepost 96, and I've included a tract of land (owned by the state, I believe) just to the southwest ("over the fence").  The community is heavily forested with tropical hardwood hammock, and the land "over the fence" is all pristine hammock, as well.  It is on the bay side, including a narrow margin of mangroves along the water.  Forest is dominated by gumbo limbo (_Bursera simarouba_), oysterwood (_Gymnanthes lucida_), spanish and white stopped (_Eugenia foetida_ and _E. axillaris_), dogwood (_Piscidia piscipula_), mahogany (_Swietenia mahogoni_), pigeon plum (_Coccoloba diversifolia_), and strongbark (_Bourreria succulenta_).	NULL
3	13	1		This is a hammock located on south Key Largo shortly before the Overseas highway turns on its way into Tavernier.  There's a nice plot on the ocean side with a big fence and grassy area with sign and everything, and a little farther southwest there's another plot on the bay side.  I include an additional area farther down-key on the ocean side accessible behind a sign talking about a old dump which leads to a large open area with a large man-made "lake".	The bay side is hammock blending rapidly into coastal buttonwood scrub with a narrow zone of mangroves along the water.\n\nThe ocean side has a large buffer of lush hardwood hammock, followed by a strip of rockland (a highly unusual community on the keys, the legacy of some sort of development from the early 1900's maybe?), and then a very broad mangrove zone that terminates finally in the eponymous Dove Creek (it might continue beyond the creek, but I've never ventured over there).	Airplants (_Tillandsia_ spp.) and lichens (_Ramalina_, _Heterodermia_, _Leptogium_) abound in the open, well-ventillated, periodically inundated buttonwood scrub on the bay side.  It might benefit from enrichment from the neighboring bird sanctuary, as well.\n\nSimilar species can be found in the rockland strip on the ocean side, as well, but less abundantly.  This is also the location of the only _Cladonia_ I've seen on any of the Keys (_C. parasitica_ on old weathered buttonwood log).\n\nThe hammock is dominated by poisonwood (_Metopium toxiferum_), spanish stopper (_Eugenia foetida_), dogwood (_Piscidia piscipula_), gumbo limbo (_Busera simarouba_), black ironwood (_Krugiodendron ferrum_), and buttonwood (_Conocarpus erectus_).\n\nThe rockland is mostly buttonwood and Christmas berry (_Lycium carolinianum_).

It is a popular spot on the ocean side just past where the overseas highway veers off and heads for the mainland.  There's a little parking lot right on the side of the road.  It is the location of an illegal development that was nearly finished several decades ago (I guess they didn't grease quite enough hands!).  It contains a large amount of lush tropical hardwood hammock (some of the finest still in existence on the "mainland" US), coastal buttonwood scrub, mangrove, and rocklands (from quaries used to build the development).  All the usual species, but a particularly good place to find lancewood (_Ocotea coriacea_) and willow bustic (_Sideroxylon salicifolia_).	NULL

The RPPN has an exceptional diversity due to different vegetation types and is very well preserved. The Rio Cristalino Forest Reserve and the surroundings of Alta Floresta are well known for birding, more than 600 species of birds can be encountered. Fungi are abundant during the rainy season.\n \nCristalino Jungle Lodge itself has a Private Reserve with more than 29,652 acres (46 square miles).  GPS: 9°35'50.71"S   55°55'52.33"W. The Cristalino Jungle Lodge is located at the Rio Cristalino, a tributary to the Teles Pires River. The Rio Teles Pires River is joining the Rio Juruena to form the Rio Tapajós, which is a major tributary of the Amazon. The area is a biodiversity hotspot, with 600 bird species, 55 mammal species, more than 600 butterfly species as well as countless species of insects to name just a fraction of the biodiversity.\n\nGeology: The parent rock for the soil is mostly granite which is partially interrupted with basalt transitions. Granite can be found in many parts of the aera, in some parts it forms hills up to 120m. In general, all soils have a very high proportion of clay. Three main soil types can be distinguished. The clay strongly reductive, Gleysol can be found near the river, where it has evolved through constant water influence. The largest area is covered by Oxisol -this deeply weathered soil is rich in aluminum and iron oxides, very clayey, but very poor in nutrients. On the Granite plateaus flat soils dominate, being very humus-rich and having a high proportion of the starting substrate.\n \nVegetation: The vegetation is composed of Tetragastris altissima (22%), Celtis schippii (17%) and Pseudolmedia sp. (6%), with an average canopy height of 30 m but with some emergent trees reaching up to 45 m in height. See also summary of FLORA CRISTALINO PROGRAM (Fundação Ecológica Cristalino / Royal Botanic Gardens/ Kew (UK) and Mato Grosso State University (UNEMAT))     http://cristalinolodge.net/content.php?lang=en&cat=vegetation\n \nClimate: Annual precipitation +/- 2800mm. Annual average temperature is 25.4 ° C. According to Köppen and Geiger the climate type is classified as “Aw climate”. In summer there is significantly more precipitation than in winter.  From May to September there is a dry season, the driest month, with 8mm rainfall is in July. The wettest month is February with 400 mm rainfall.			\n \nSpecies (other than Fungi):     http://www.cristalinolodge.com.br/content.php?lang=pt&cat=listas-de-especies

Eastern white pine (__Pinus strobus__) forms the bulk of large areas of the forest proper. In its eastern fringes, isolated trees and stands of jack pine (__Pinus banksiana__) occur. Some areas have spruce. I've not noted cedar in this area.\n\nBirch, beech, maple, and some other hardwoods also occur. Large parts of the woods are mixed with pine, spruce, birch, beech, and maple. East of the main woods stands of birch occur, sometimes mixed with a few white pines. Scattered single oak trees appear here and there.\n\nSome patches are dominated by tall pines; others by hardwoods. The mycobiota seems to vary from one area to the next. There are at least three areas that have particularly high species counts and distinctive species: a low, damp area of mixed trees without oak or jack pine; a stand of white pine with a mossy floor, little underbrush, and some birch, oak, and jack pine at various locations on its border but a pure interior; and an area with stands of jack pine with mossy floors. The meadow areas east of the woods and out from under trees have their own species.\n\nIn some areas disturbed by human recreational activities, large false morels grow in the late spring.

It is readily accessible from US Highway 1 less than an hour(?) south of Monterey.  It is situated on a complex of rocky promontories jutting into the cold Alaskan current.  It is ideally suited for lichens adapted to thrive in the fog belt, including _Niebla_, _Dendrographa_, and several odd fruticose forms of typically crustose genera, e.g., _Caloplaca coralloides_ and _Lecanora phryganitis_.  Furthermore, seabirds (and more importantly to the lichenologist, their droppings) are abundant, providing extensive nutrient-enriched substrate along bluffs, seastacks and in the coastal scrub.  Lastly, a renowned grove of the rare Monterey Cypress (_Cupressa macrocarpa_) potentially providing a large and unique habitat for yet more lichens. [I'm thinking of some crustose species I saw in the grove but didn't collect; I didn't see them anywhere else, so I'm assuming they must have narrow substrate preference. I would expect at least a few unusual lichens to be present in such a situation. -Jason]	There are several major habitat types present.\n\n1. Coastal conifer forest.  Dry and relatively open, but close enough to the sea to be significantly enriched by marine aerosols and reliable morning fog.  Dominated by _Pinus_ spp.  Typical hypermaritime epiphytic lichen flora.\n\n2. Monterrey cypress grove.  Situated on a rocky bluff surrounded on three sides by the sea.  Very open and exposed to fog and sea spray.  Almost entirely dominated by _Cupressus macrocarpa_.  The lichenological highlight is a spectacular community of the otherwise uncommon _Dendrographa leucophaea_ and _D. alectoroides_ (see _observation 69289_ and _observation 13476_ for discussion).\n\n3. Coastal scrub / chaparral.  The bluffs overlooking the sea are typical bare of trees, covered instead with a dense growth of scrub oak and other species.  If you can brave the thicket, this is a particularly excellent place to study _Ramalina_ spp. and _Niebla cephalota_.\n\n4. Coastal bluffs.  Granitic outcrops high above the spray zone.  Very dry in terms of rain, but humidity is extremely abundant and reliable.  Since chlorolichens (those containing green algae as their photobiont) can photosynthesize in humidity as low as 80%, this provides an ideal habitat that is virtually globally unique (occurring also along the northern Chilean coast and to a lesser extent the Canary Islands).  Trails run right along the edge of the bluff in a number of places, giving ready access to a number of spectacular lichen communities.  This is the place to study the six? saxicolous species of _Niebla_.\n\n5. Sea stacks and spray zone.  Closer to the sea, especially where sea birds congregate, is a highly enriched habitat on exposed but rarely inundated granitic outcrops.  Species of _Caloplaca_ are particularly abundant.  There is also at least one excellent population of _Dendrographa_ near the Monterrey Cypress grove.	This is a prime location to find and study several interesting lichens characteristic of the central and southern California coast:\n\n_Caloplaca coralloides_\n_Dendrographa alectoroides_\n_Dendrographa leucophaea_\n_Lecanora phryganitis_\n_Niebla cephalota_\n_Niebla ceruchoides_\n_Niebla combeoides_\n_Niebla homalea_\n_Niebla laevigata_\n_Niebla polymorpha_\n_Niebla procera_\n_Ramalina farinacea_\n_Ramalina leptocarpha_\n_Ramalina menziesii_\n_Ramalina pollinaria_\n_Ramalina subleptocarpha_\n\nAdditional macrolichens (from predominantly epiphytic genera) which should be present (extracted from _Sonoran Flora_)\n\n_Candelaria concolor_\n_Candelaria pacifica_\n_Collema furfuraceum_\n_Collema nigrescens_\n_Dendrographa alectoroides_\n_Dendrographa leucophaea_\n_Evernia prunastri_\n_Flavoparmelia caperata_\n_Flavopunctelia flaventior_\n_Heterodermia leucomela_\n_Heterodermia namaquana_\n_Hypogymnia gracilis_\n_Hypogymnia heterophylla_\n_Hypogymnia imshaugii_\n_Hypogymnia occidentalis_\n_Hypogymnia physodes_\n_Hypogymnia tubulosa_\n_Kaernefeltia merrillii_\n_Leptogium californicum_\n_Leptogium lichenoides_\n_Leptogium milligranum_\n_Leptogium pseudofurfuraceum_\n_Leptogium saturninum_\n_Leptogium tenuissimum_\n_Letharia columbiana_\n_Letharia vulpina_\n_Melanelia fuliginosa_\n_Melanelia subargentifera_\n_Nephroma helveticum ssp. helveticum_\n_Nodobryoria abbreviata_\n_Normandina pulchella_\n_Parmelia sulcata_\n_Parmelina quercina_\n_Parmotrema chinense_\n_Parmotrema crinitum_\n_Parmotrema stuppeum_\n_Phaeophyscia hirsuta_\n_Phaeophyscia orbicularis_\n_Physcia adscendens_\n_Physcia aipolia var. aipolia_\n_Physcia biziana_\n_Physcia dimidiata_\n_Physcia stellaris_\n_Physcia tribacia_\n_Physconia americana_\n_Physconia californica_\n_Physconia enteroxantha_\n_Physconia fallax_\n_Physconia isidiigera_\n_Physconia leucoleiptes_\n_Physconia perisidiosa_\n_Platismatia glauca_\n_Pseudocyphellaria anomala_\n_Punctelia borreri_\n_Punctelia perreticulata_\n_Sticta fuliginosa_\n_Teloschistes chrysophthalmus_\n_Teloschistes flavicans_\n_Tuckermannopsis chlorophylla_\n_Tuckermannopsis orbata_\n_Usnea fulvoreagens_\n_Usnea lapponica_\n_Usnea rubicunda_\n_Usnea scabrata_\n_Vulpicida canadensis_\n_Waynea californica_\n_Xanthomendoza fallax_\n_Xanthomendoza oregana_\n_Xanthoria candelaria_\n\nSome additional macrolichens: (various sources)\n\n_Cladonia chlorophaea_\n_Cladonia hammeri_\n_Cladonia macilenta_\n_Hypocenomyce scalaris_\n_Neofuscelia verruculifera_\n_Peltigera collina_\n_Peltigera membranacea_\n_Peltigera praetextata_

212	946	1		In 1987 Sherbrooke Forest, Doongalla Reserve and Ferntree Gully National Park were combined to form Dandenong Ranges National Park. Covering 3215 hectares, the park plays an important role in protecting a population of famous lyrebirds and other fauna, as well as protecting the forests and fern gullies of the Ranges. Since June 1997 Olinda State Forest and the Mt Evelyn Forest have also been included in Dandenong Ranges National Park.\n\n\nVegetation\n\nThe plant communities in the park are remnants of the original vegetation that has receded over the last 150 years with the rapid growth of Melbourne's suburbs.\n\nDandenong Ranges National Park has six major vegetation communities in which about 400 indigenous plant species occur. The park is particularly well known for its spectacular Mountain Ash forests and fern gullies.\n\nOther vegetation communities include Cool Temperate Rainforest, Box Stringybark Woodland, Riparian Forest, Mountain Grey Gum -Messmate Forest and Sclerophyll Woodland. The park supports significant plants such as the Slender Tree-fern and Summer Spider Orchid. Fire plays an important role in the ecology of the vegetation and is an on-going issue for residents of the Ranges.

255	1267	1		A suburb just North of Seattle. Bordered by Seattle, Lake Forest Park, Mountlake Terrace, and the Puget Sound.\n\nShoreline is a city in King County, Washington, United States, 15 miles (24 km) north of Downtown Seattle. As of the 2000 census, the population was 53,025, making it the 14th largest city in the state of Washington.\n\nBased on per capita income, one of the more reliable measures of affluence, Shoreline ranks 91st of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked.\n\nHistory\n\nShoreline began in 1890 with the platting of the neighborhood of Richmond Beach, on Puget Sound, in anticipation of the arrival of the Great Northern Railway the next year. Over the next two decades, Shoreline was connected to Seattle via the Seattle-Everett Interurban streetcar line (1906) and a newly paved North Trunk Road (now Aurora Avenue N., State Route 99) (1913), helping to increase its population.\n\nThe name "Shoreline" first came to be applied to this stretch of unincorporated King County in 1944, when it was given to the school district. As the school district boundaries stretched from "Shore to Shore" (Puget Sound to Lake Washington) and "Line to Line" (the old Seattle city limit of 85th St to the Snohomish County Line). Though the modern borders of the city do not stretch to Lake Washington, the area kept the "Shoreline" name.\n\nAfter the incorporation of Lake Forest Park in 1961, the remainder of the Shoreline School District remained an unincorporated portion of King County. Fifty-one years after it had been named, on August 31, 1995 Shoreline was officially incorporated as a code city and adopted the council-manager form of government. (See City government in the state of Washington.)\n[edit] Police\n\nShoreline contracts with the King County Sheriff's Office for police services. Deputies assigned to Shoreline wear city uniforms and drive patrol cars marked with the city logo. There are currently 46 commissioned officers and one chief assigned full time to the city. The Shoreline department currently has a burglary/larceny unit, traffic unit, and a street crimes unit.\n[edit] Geography\n\nShoreline is located at 47°45′23″N 122°20′23″W﻿ / ﻿47.75639°N 122.33972°W﻿ / 47.75639; -122.33972 (47.756519, -122.339657).[4]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 11.7 square miles (30.3 km²), of which, 11.7 square miles (30.2 km²) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km²) of it (0.17%) is water.\n\nThere are 330 acres (1.3 km²) of park land in Shoreline, divided among 25 parks.

Jointly managed by UW and the City of Seattle, its 230 acres are a dynamic assortment of plants found nowhere else. The City owns the land and the University owns all of the trees and plant collections. In terms of care, maintenance and management, the City takes care of the park-like functions (trails, benches, garbage) and the UW Botanic Gardens takes care of the gardens, trees, and plant collections. The Graham Visitors Center contains an information desk and a gift shop managed by the Arboretum Foundation. The Japanese Garden, located at the south end of the Arboretum has an entrance fee and is managed by the City of Seattle."\n\nWashington Park is a public park in Seattle, Washington, USA, most of which is taken up by the Washington Park Arboretum, a joint project of the University of Washington, the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation, and the nonprofit Arboretum Foundation. Washington Park also includes a playfield and the Seattle Japanese Garden in its southwest corner. The entire length of Arboretum Creek is within the park.\n\nTo the north is Union Bay; to the west are Montlake and Madison Valley; to the south is the Washington Park neighborhood; and to the east is the Broadmoor Golf Club.\n\nLake Washington Boulevard E. runs north and south through the park, parallel to the creek. A secondary road, for most of its length named Arboretum Drive E. and for a short northern stretch named E. Foster Island Road, runs along the Arboretum's eastern edge. E. Interlaken Boulevard and Boyer Avenue E. run northwest out of the park to Montlake and beyond. State Route 520 cuts through Foster Island and the Union Bay wetlands at the park's northern end, interchanging with Lake Washington Boulevard just outside the arboretum entrance.\n\nThe land upon Washington Park Arboretum has been developed is owned by the city, but the Arboretum is operated primarily by the University of Washington.\n\nWashington Park was developed on land that had been logged by the Puget Mill Company for sixty years. In 1920, the parcel was split in two. The eastern 200 acres (0.8 km²) were developed as the Broadmoor Golf Club by a group of businessmen that included E. G. Ames, general manager of Puget Mill. The western 230 were given to the city, who developed a park and arboretum on the site.\n\nThe potential impact of the recent plans to reconstruct and expand State Route 520 and replace the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge have raised concerns among Arboretum staff and park users.[1] As the members of the Arboretum community noted in their collective letter to the Washington State Department of Transportation, "Native plants, wetlands, and wildlife ... would be affected not only by the taking of land but by the looming shadows created by roadways in various proposals".[2] Among the alternative proposals is the "Arboretum Bypass Plan," building the new elevated highway over Union Bay on a more northerly route than the current one	Anything and everything!

272	1298	1		Woodland Park Zoo is a zoological garden around the Green Lake neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. Occupying the western half of Woodland Park, the zoo began as a small menagerie on the estate of Guy C. Phinney, a Canadian-born lumber mill owner and real estate developer. Opened in 1899, the 188-acre (0.76 km2) Woodland Park was sold to the city for $5,000 in cash and the assumption of a $95,000 mortgage on December 28, 1899, by Phinney's wife (Phinney had died six years earlier, in 1893). The sum was so large that the Seattle mayor vetoed the acquisition, only to be over-ruled by the city council. In 1902, the Olmsted Brothers firm of Boston was hired to design the city's parks, including Woodland Park, and the next year the collection of the private Leschi Park menagerie was moved to Phinney Ridge.\n\nAs of the summer of 2010, the zoo includes 92 acres (263,000 m²) of exhibits and public spaces. It is open to the public daily, and an entrance fee of $16.50 per adult (13-64); $11.00 for children (3-12); free for children 2 and younger is required from May 1 to September 30. The fee goes down to $11.00 for adults and $8.00 for children from October 1 to April 30.\n\nIts collection includes:\n\n    * 1,090 animal specimens\n    * 300 animal species\n    * 35 endangered and five threatened animal species\n    * 7,000 trees\n    * 50,000+ shrubs and herbs\n    * 1,000+ plant species\n\nWoodland Park Zoo had 1.05 million visitors in 2006.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland_Park_Zoo

The population was 33,847 at the 2000 census, making it the third largest in Snohomish County and twenty-fourth largest in Washington State. The city is an indefinable mix of urban, suburban, small city, crossroads and bedroom community to many professionals who work in Seattle. Lynnwood is known to be the "hub city" of south Snohomish County because of all the retail shopping. Straddling the junction between Interstate 5 and the north end of Interstate 405 in Washington, it is the final tangle of population on the north end of "greater Seattle" before one continues on to other places: Everett, Bellingham, or Vancouver, BC. Its climate is wet and cool, wetter than that of Seattle. The center of the town at 44th Avenue West and 196th Southwest has the usual American panoply of small businesses, strip malls, and retail stores. Outside the commercial center of Lynnwood, to the east and north, lie Alderwood Mall, houses, and portions of the green belt.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynnwood,_Washington

279	1301	1		Spokane (play /spoʊˈkæn/, us dict: spō·kăn′) is a city located in the Northwestern United States in the state of Washington. It is the largest city and county seat of Spokane County,[5] as well as the metropolitan center of the Inland Northwest region. The city is located on the Spokane River in Eastern Washington, 110 miles (180 km) south of the Canadian border, approximately 20 miles (32 km) from the Washington-Idaho border, and 271 miles (436 km) east of Seattle.\n\nDavid Thompson explored the Spokane area and began European settlement with the westward expansion and establishment of the North West Company’s Spokane House in 1810. This trading post was the first long-term European settlement in Washington and the center of the fur trade between the Rockies and the Cascades for 16 years. In the late 1800s, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Northwest. The Spokane area is considered to be one of the most productive mining districts in North America. Spokane’s economy has traditionally been natural resource based, however, the city’s economy has diversified to encompass other industries, including the high-tech and biotech sectors.\n\nThe city of Spokane (then known as "Spokane Falls") was settled in 1871 and officially incorporated as a city in 1881. The city's name is drawn from the Native American tribe known as the Spokane, which means "Children of the Sun" in Salish.[6] The name is often mispronounced "Spo-CAIN", while the correct pronunciation is "Spo-CAN". Spokane's official nickname is the "Lilac City", named after the flowers that have flourished since their introduction to the area in the early 20th century.[7] Completion of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1881 brought major settlement to the Spokane area.\n\nWith a population of 202,319 as of 2008, Spokane is the second largest city in Washington, and the third largest in the American portion of the Pacific Northwest, behind Seattle, and Portland, Oregon. The City Of Spokane is slightly larger than Tacoma. Spokane is the principal city of the Spokane Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is coterminous with Spokane County. As of 2008, the county had a population of 462,677.[8]\n\nDirectly east of Spokane County is the Coeur d'Alene Metropolitan Statistical Area, comprised entirely of Kootenai County, Idaho; the combined population of the two counties was estimated at 600,152 in 2008, fourth largest in the Pacific Northwest behind Seattle, Portland, and Vancouver, Canada.[9]\n\nSpokane's Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is expected to be officially combined with Kootenai County by the Federal Government and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget once the 2010 Census is tallied. The new MSA is likely to be named "Spokane-Coeur d'Alene Metropolitan Area". It is expected that by that time, the area will have upwards of 650,000, and this change will occur no later than 2013.[10]				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane,_Washington
280	1302	1		Vancouver is a city on the north bank of the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington. Incorporated in 1857, it is the fourth largest city in the state with an estimated population of 165,809 as of July 1, 2009.[7] Vancouver is the county seat of Clark County and forms part of the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area, the 23rd-largest metropolitan area in the United States.\n\nVancouver shares its name with the larger city of Vancouver located 305 miles (491 km) north in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Both cities were named in honor of sea captain George Vancouver, although the Canadian city was incorporated 29 years after the incorporation of Vancouver, Washington, and more than 60 years after the name Vancouver was first used in reference to the historic Fort Vancouver trading post on the Columbia River. City officials have periodically suggested changing the US city's name to Fort Vancouver, Vancouver USA, or even Old Vancouver to reduce confusion with its northern neighbor. Many Pacific Northwest residents distinguish between the two cities by referring to the Canadian city as "Vancouver, B.C." and the United States one as "Vancouver, Washington" or "Vancouver USA." Local nicknames include: "Vantucky"[8][9] and "The 'Couv(e).[10]"				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver,_Washington
281	1306	1		Magnuson Park is a 350 acre (140 ha) park on Sand Point at Pontiac Bay, Lake Washington, in the Sand Point neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. The park is the second largest in Seattle after 534 acre (220 ha) Discovery Park in Magnolia. Sand Point is the peninsula with Pontiac and Wolf bays that juts into Lake Washington.\n\nThe first park at Sand Point was established in 1900 as Carkeek Park, a gift from developers Mr. and Mrs. Morgan J. Carkeek. After World War I, a movement was begun to build Naval Air Station (NAS) Sand Point, and King County began acquiring surrounding parcels. In 1922 the Navy began construction on the site, which it was leasing from the county, and in 1926 the Navy was deeded the 413-acre (1.67 km2) field outright. The name Carkeek Park was subsequently given to a new park north of Ballard. This deed amounted to a public gift of $500,000 from the county to the Navy, in 1926 dollars; this would be $5,283,000 in 2005 dollars, not including significant real estate appreciation.[2] The Seattle Chamber of Commerce—a commercial entity—had done the same thing for the Army 28 years before with Fort Lawton, much of which is now Discovery Park.\n\nIn 1970 the airfield shut down, and negotiations began as to who would receive the surplus property. In 1975 a large portion of the Navy's land was given to the City of Seattle and to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The city's land was largely developed as a park and named Sand Point Park. In 1977, it was renamed Magnuson Park in honor of Washington Senator Warren G. Magnuson. Both names are in use. Fourteen years later, in 1991, the naval installation closed completely, and the remaining land was divided among several entities including the city.\nAerial photograph of the Naval Air Station Seattle in the 1940s.\n\nMagnuson Park is home to Seattle's biggest playground, the Junior League of Seattle Children's Playground which was designed, developed and funded through the efforts of the Junior League of Seattle, a women's leadership and volunteer organization. Spearheaded by prominent Seattle resident, Mary Herche, the Playground celebrated its 10th anniversary on Saturday, May 16 where children played in the 20,000 square feet (1,900 m2) of colorful climbing walls, sand box, swings, slides and much more.\n\nThe Junior League of Seattle donated and dedicated this "Air, Land and Sea" playground to the children of Seattle to commemorate the organization's 75 years of community service. The playground was designed partly by children and built entirely by volunteers at the site of the former Naval Air Station Control Tower.\n\nSand Point provides habitat for the second richest bird habitat of any park in Seattle, with 170 species reported. In addition, Magnuson Park today features several sports fields, a picnic area, a swimming beach, public sailboating,[3] many paths for walking and bicycling, a dog park or off-leash dog area and "Kite Hill", a large grassy man-made hill that was made from pieces of the old aircraft runway. Vehicle access includes boat launch ramps and large parking lots for cars, trucks, and boat trailers. As of Fall, 2005, the City of Seattle has a development plan that features a large sports field complex of approximately ten fields, with seven to be well lit, and this plan has encountered opposition from neighborhood groups, environmental and park advocates.\n\nThe park also has a history of unofficial clothing-optional use since the mid 1970s. Sporadic and quiet use is in the northeast part of the Park, east of NOAA. Long-term volunteer efforts continue toward enhancing safe and legal use. Magnuson Beach Bares as MagnusonBeach.org has recently begun posting organized events for these purposes (August 2006). Magnuson Park is one of about two dozen locations in Seattle.

284	1310	1		Eatonville is a town in Pierce County, Washington, United States. The population was 2,012 at the 2000 census.\n\nFor centuries, Indian people roamed the rivers and streams of the Eatonville area. Indian Henry was one of those, who in 1889, guided the town's founder, Thomas C. Van Eaton, from Mashell Prairie to the present site of Eatonville. It is said that upon arrival, Henry declared, "This good place. Not much snow."\n\nArea settlers and Indians were in need of goods, which "T.C." provided at his trading post. Supplies were carried by his stage from Spanaway over a rough trail through dense forest. In 1891, the settlers built the town's first school, which is still in use.\n\nFor years Eatonville was a waypoint for visitors to Mount Rainier. In 1902, the Tacoma Eastern Railroad arrived, providing freight and passenger service and a vital link to Tacoma. Soon after the railroad's arrival, several small mills sprang up in the vicinity. In the 70's, the Wildlife park of Northwest Trek was opened and it remains to be one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area, other than Mount Rainier itself.\n\nEatonville was officially incorporated on October 28, 1909, after the Eatonville Lumber Company brought in more people to work in its mill. The mill's closure in 1954 was a blow to the town, but community spirit and good schools have kept Eatonville alive and growing. Recently, the town became the home of a Concrete manufacturing plant, Nybo concrete.\n\nHistory found at EatonvilleChamber.com, and comes directly from a Pierce County Landmark marker found at the intersection of Mashell Ave and Center St. in Eatonville, Washington.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eatonville,_Washington
285	1313	1		Beaverton is a city in Washington County, Oregon, United States, seven miles (11 km) west of Portland in the Tualatin River Valley. As of 2008[update], its population is estimated to be 86,205,[3] almost 14% more than the 2000 census figure of 76,129. This makes it the second-largest city in the county and Oregon's sixth-largest city. In 2010, Beaverton was named by Money magazine as one of the 100 "best places to live", among smaller cities, in the country.[4][5]\n\nAccording to Oregon Geographic Names, Beaverton got its name because of the settlement's proximity to a large body of water resulting from beaver dams.\n\nThe area of Tualatin Valley which became Beaverton was originally the home of a Native American tribe known as the Atfalati which settlers mispronounced as Tualatin. The Atfalati population dwindled in the latter part of the 18th century, and the prosperous tribe was no longer dominant in the area by the 19th century when settlers arrived.[6]				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaverton,_Oregon
286	1314	1		Hurricane Ridge is a mountainous area in Washington's Olympic National Park. It can be accessed by road from Port Angeles and is open to hiking, skiing, and snowboarding.\n\nAt an elevation of about 5,200 feet (1,585 m), Hurricane Ridge is a year-round destination. In summer, visitors come for views of the Olympic Mountains, as well as for superb hiking. During the winter months the small, family oriented Hurricane Ridge Ski and Snowboard Area offers lift-serviced downhill skiing and snowboarding.\n\nHurricane Ridge is named for its intense gales and winds. The weather in the Olympic Mountains is unpredictable, and visitors should be prepared for snow at any time of year.\n\nThe Hurricane Ridge Ski and Snowboard Area is located in the higher elevations of Olympic National Park. Nearly a mile high (~1,600 m), the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center offers spectacular winter recreation and activities on the north Olympic Peninsula, and features winter vistas unmatched anywhere in the Pacific Northwest.\nA view from Hurricane Ridge in the fall taken near the visitor center.\n\nThe day facility built atop ONP's Hurricane Ridge consists of a small, family oriented ski area for both downhill and cross-country skiers. The area is equipped with tow rope tows and one poma lift—offering to Olympic Peninsula residents and visitors a quality winter sports experience without the cost and crowds of larger commercial ski areas. The Ridge boasts some groomed area—and for the accomplished skier or snowboarder the steeps, bowls and glades are well worth the hikes to get there. With a summit elevation of 5,240 feet (1,600 m), there is generally an annual snowfall of 400-plus inches (10+ m).\nA view of the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center taken from the Intermediate Ski Slope and Rope Tow Area in the summertime. The Poma Lift drops down directly into the basin hidden in the right of the photograph, while the Beginner's (or "Bunny Slope") Rope Tow is set up on the gentler slopes near the road and parking lot. All lifts are taken down by the Park in the summer for aesthetic purposes.\n\nUnmatched vistas are available for cross-country skiers who can pursue the old lookout landmark on the summit of Hurricane Hill while accessing direct views of the backside of Mt. Carrie and (on a clear day) partial views of the summit of Mount Olympus. A longer, and possibly more satisfying trip for the serious winter traveler, can be accessed in the opposite direction by following the 12 miles (19 km) of snow covered high mountain road to Obstruction Point. Passing the legendary Steeple Rock summit, overnight skiers (and/or snowshoers) have the option of staying in the A-frame (aka "Waterhole") located 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8 km) down the road—complete with wood stove and split wood on a first-come-first-served basis.\n\nThe Hurricane Ridge Winter Sports Club was formed as a non-profit corporation in 1986 for the purpose of promoting and providing organized leadership for winter sports activities at Hurricane Ridge. The HRWSC operates the ski lifts under permit with Olympic National Park, and strives to be a good steward of the environment while promoting healthy outdoor activities for the youth, community and visitors of the Olympic Peninsula.\n\nFrom Seattle or Olympia, follow Highway 101 into Port Angeles, turning south onto Race Street, watch for the sign, and make a slight right onto the Hurricane Ridge Parkway. The National Park charges an entrance fee, $15 per car, or purchase a yearly pass for $30. The road generally opens to uphill traffic at 9am and closes to uphill traffic at 4pm.

287	1316	1		Mount Adams is a potentially active[6] stratovolcano in the Cascade Range and the second-highest mountain in the U.S. state of Washington.[7] Adams is a member of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, and is one of the arc's largest volcanoes,[8] located in a remote wilderness approximately 31 miles (50 km) east of Mount St. Helens.[9] The Mount Adams Wilderness comprises the upper and western part of the volcano's cone. The eastern side of the mountain is part of the Yakama Nation.[10]\n\nAdams' asymmetrical and broad body rises 1.5 miles (2.4 km) above the Cascade crest. Its nearly flat summit was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. Air travelers flying the busy routes above the area sometimes confuse Mount Adams with nearby Mount Rainier, which has a similar flat-topped shape.\n\nThe Pacific Crest Trail traverses the western flank of the mountain.[11][12] Although Adams has not erupted in over 1,400 years, it is not considered extinct.\n\nNative Americans in the area have composed many legends concerning the three "smoking mountains" that guard the Columbia River. According to the Bridge of the Gods tale, Wy'east (Mount Hood) and Pahto (Mount Adams; also called Paddo or Klickitat by native peoples) were the sons of the Great Spirit. The brothers both competed for the love of the beautiful La-wa-la-clough (Mount St. Helens). When La-wa-la-clough chose Pahto, Wy'east struck his brother hard so that Pahto's head was flattened and Wy'east took La-wa-la-clough from him (thus attempting to explain Adams' squat appearance). Other versions of the story state that losing La-wa-la-clough caused Pahto such grief that he dropped his head in shame.[13][14][15]\n\nIn 1805 the Lewis and Clark Expedition recorded seeing the mountain. They misidentified it as Mount St. Helens which had been previously discovered and named. This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.[16]\n\nBetween 1830 and 1834 Hall J. Kelley led a campaign to rename the Cascade Range as the President's Range and also to rename each major Cascade mountain after a former President of the United States. Mount Adams was not known to Kelley and was thus not in his plan. Mount Hood, in fact, was designated by Kelley to be renamed after President John Adams but a mistake by a mapmaker placed the Mount Adams name north of Mount Hood and about 40 miles (60 km) east of Mount St. Helens. By sheer coincidence there was in fact a large mountain there to receive the name. Since the mountain had no official name at the time, Kelley's name stuck even though the rest of his plan failed.[17] In 1901, local settler and mountaineer C. E. Rusk led noted glaciologist Harry Reid to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant glaciers.[18]\n\nIn 1929 and 1931 Wade Dean filed mining claims to the sulfur on Adams' 210-acre (0.8 km2) summit plateau. After building a horse and mule trail, he had a diamond-tipped drilling machine moved to the summit area and test pits were drilled. Although sulfur sludge was found, the amount and quality of the ore was never good enough to make the venture profitable and the project was abandoned in 1959. Adams is the only large Cascade volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.[19]\n[edit] Glaciers\nMount Adams southeast side, showing the heavily glaciated cirque.\n\nIce, mostly in the form of glaciers, covers about 6.2 square miles (16.1 km2) of the mountain's upper cone. Water from melting ice and rain slowly percolates through the very porous interior of the main cone and flows out through springs near the base of the volcano.\n\nGlaciers cover a total of 2.5% of Adams' surface but during the last ice age about 90% of the mountain was glaciated. Most of the largest remaining glaciers (including the Adams, Klickitat, Lyman, and White Salmon) originate from Adams' summit ice cap. On the northwest face of the mountain, Adams Glacier cascades down a steep channel in a series of icefalls before spreading out and terminating at around the 7,000 feet (2,100 m). Klickitat Glacier on the volcano's eastern flank originates in a 1 mile (1.6 km) wide cirque and is fed by two smaller glaciers from the summit ice cap. It terminates around 6,000 feet (1,800 m). In the Cascades, Adams Glacier is second in size only to Carbon Glacier on Mount Rainier.[20]\n[edit] Geology\n\nAdams is made of several overlapping cones that together form an 18-mile (29 km) diameter base which is elongated in its north-south axis and covers an area of 250 square miles (650 km2). The volcano has a volume of 85 cubic miles (350 km3) placing it second only to Mount Shasta in that category among the Cascade stratovolcanoes.[8] Mount Adams was probably created by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate, which is located just off the coast of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nMount Adams was born in the relatively late Pleistocene and grew in several pulses of mostly lava-extruding eruptions. Each eruptive cycle was separated from one another by long periods of dormancy during which glaciers eroded the mountain to below 9,000 feet (2,700 m). Potassium-argon dating has identified two such eruptive periods; the first occurring 275,000 to 200,000 years ago and the second 150,000 to 100,000 years ago. Most of these eruptions and therefore most of the volcano, consist of lava flows with little tephra. The loose material that makes up much of Adams' core is made of brecciated lava.[8]\nMount Adams as seen from Mount St. Helens\n\nAndesite and basalt flows formed a 20 to 200 feet (6 to 60 m) thick circle around the base of the Mount Adams, and filled existing depressions and ponded in valleys. Most of the volcano is made of andesite together with handful of dacite and pyroclastic flows which erupted early in Adams' development. The present main cone was built when Adams was capped by a glacier system in the last ice age. The lava that erupted was shattered when it came in contact with the ice and the cone interior is therefore made of easily eroded andesite fragments. Since its construction, constant emissions of heat and caustic gases have transformed much of the rock into clays (mostly kaolinite), iron oxides, sulfur-rich compounds and quartz.[21]\n\nThe present eruptive cone above 7,000 feet (2,100 m) was constructed sometime between 25,000 to 10,000 years ago. Since that time the volcano has erupted at least seven times, all of which were above 6,500 feet (1,980 m) on the summit. One of the most recent flows issued from South Butte and created the 4.5-mile (7.2 km) long by 0.5-mile (0.8 km) wide A.G. Aiken Lava Bed. This flow looks young but has 3,500 year old Mount St. Helens ash on it meaning it is at least that old. The last lava known to have erupted from Adams are the 2,500 to 3,500 year old Muddy Fork lava flows.[6]\n\nThe Trout Lake Mudflow is the youngest large debris flow from Adams and the only large one since the end of the last Ice Age. The flow dammed Trout Creek and covered 25 miles (40 km) of the White Salmon River valley. Impounded water later formed Trout Lake. The Great Slide of 1921 started close to the headwall of the White Salmon Glacier and was the largest avalanche on Adams in historic time. The slide fell about 1 mile (1.6 km) and its debris covered about 1 square mile (2.6 km2) of the upper Salt Creek area. Steam vents were reported active at the slide source for three years, leading to speculation that the event was started with a small steam explosion.[21] This was the only debris flow in Mount Adam's recorded history, but there are five known lahars.[19]\n\nSince then, thermal anomalies (hot spots) and gas emissions (including hydrogen sulfide) have occurred especially on the summit plateau. This indicates that Adams is dormant, not extinct. It still has the potential to become active. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of andesite or basalt. Since the interior of the main cone is little more than a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large landslides and other debris flows.[21]\n\nThe Indian Heaven volcanic field is located between St. Helens and Adams. Its principal feature are an 18 miles (30 km) long linear zone of shield volcanoes, cinder cones, and flows with volumes of up to 23 cubic miles (100 km3). The shield volcanoes, which form the backbone of the volcanic field, are located on the northern and southern sides of the field. Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams are on the western and the eastern sides.[20]	Contrary to legend, the flatness of Adams' current summit area is not due to the loss of the volcano's peak. Instead it was formed as a result of cone-building eruptions from separated vents. A false summit rises 11,500 feet (3,510 m) on the south side of the nearly half-mile (800 m) wide summit area. The true summit is about 800 feet (240 m) higher on the gently sloping north side. A small lava cone marks the highest point. Suksdorf Ridge is a long buttress trending from the false summit down to an elevation of 8,000 feet (2,440 m). This structure was built by repeated lava flows in the late Pleistocene. The Pinnacle forms the northwest false summit and was created by erosion from Adams and White Salmon glaciers. The summit crater is filled with snow and is open on its west rim.[8]		The western side of Mount Adams is in the Mount Adams Wilderness within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The east side is part of the Yakama Nation. The wilderness is open to hiking, backpacking, mountain climbing and equestrian sports. A Volcano Pass from the United States Forest Service (USFS) is required for activities above a certain altitude.[22] Some areas of the Yakama Nation are open for recreation, while other areas are open only to members of the tribe.[1	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Adams_%28Washington%29
288	1317	1		Hillsboro is the fifth-largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon and is the county seat of Washington County.[5] Lying in the Tualatin Valley on the west side of the Portland metropolitan area, the city is home to many high-technology (high-tech) companies, such as Intel, that comprise what has become known as the Silicon Forest. As of 2009, the city's estimated population was about 90,000.[1]\n\nFor thousands of years before the arrival of European-American settlers, the Atfalati tribe of the Kalapuya lived in the Tualatin Valley near the later site of Hillsboro. The climate, moderated by marine influence from the Pacific Ocean, helped make the region suitable for fishing, hunting, food gathering, and agriculture. Settlers founded a community here in 1842, later named after David Hill, an Oregon politician. Transportation by riverboat on the Tualatin River was part of Hillsboro's settler economy. A railroad reached the area in the early 1870s and an interurban electric railway about four decades later. These railways, as well as highways, aided the slow growth of the city to about 2,000 people by 1910 and about 5,000 by 1950, before the arrival of high-tech companies in the 1980s.\n\nHillsboro has a council-manager government consisting of a city manager and a city council headed by a mayor. In addition to high-tech industry, sectors important to Hillsboro's economy are health care, retail sales, and agriculture, including grapes and wineries. The city operates more than twenty parks and the mixed-use Hillsboro Stadium, and nine sites in the city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Modes of transportation include private vehicles, public buses and light rail, and aircraft using the Hillsboro Airport. The city is home to Pacific University's Health Professions Campus. Notable residents include two Oregon governors.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsboro,_Oregon
289	1318	1		Sauvie Island, in the U.S. state of Oregon, originally Wapato Island or Wappatoo Island, is the largest island along the Columbia River, at 26,000 acres (105 km²). It lies approximately ten miles northwest of downtown Portland, between the Columbia River to the east, the Multnomah Channel to the west, and the Willamette River to the south. Much of the interior comprises water; Sturgeon Lake, in the north central part of the island, is the most prominent water feature. The land area is 84.82 km² (32.75 sq mi, or 20,959 acres). Most of the island is in Multnomah County, but the northern third belongs to Columbia County. The Sauvie Island Bridge provides access across the Multnomah Channel from U.S. Route 30.\n\nThe island is predominantly farmland and wildlife refuge. There were 1,078 year-round residents at the 2000 census. There is an industrial zone and small grocery store in the southeast corner, near the bridge. Bicyclists flock to the island because its flat topography and lengthy low-volume roads make it ideal for cycling. Its nearest incorporated neighbors are the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area to its south and southeast; St. Helens across the Multnomah Channel from the extreme northern tip of the island; and Scappoose, across the Multnomah Channel to the west.\n\nHistory\n\n    * 1792 - British Lieutenant William Broughton in George Vancouver's expedition explores the island and names the northern tip "Warrior Point" after being greeted offshore by 23 canoes of armed Multnomah Indians.[1]\n    * November 4, 1805 - The Lewis and Clark expedition lands, names it "Wapato Island" after the abundance of Broadleaf arrowhead plants, which are also known as "Indian potato" and were a major foodstuff for indigenous peoples in the Pacific Northwest.[2]\n    * 1832 - Much of the native population dies in an epidemic; Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver removes survivors and burns settlements.\n    * 1834 - American Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth builds and occupies Fort William, a small trading post, to compete with the British; abandoned 1836.[2]\n    * c. 1836 - Hudson's Bay Company establishes dairies on the island, managed by French-Canadian employee Laurent Sauvé (after whom the island is now named).\n    * 1851 - "Mouth of Willamette" Post Office established; renamed "Souvies Island" the following year.\n    * 1858 - James Bybee builds the Greek Revival Bybee–Howell House. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, and today is part of the Metro's Howell Territorial Park, operated by the Oregon Historical Society.[3]\n\nLooking west across the fields from Gillihan Road\n\n    * 1889 - Warrior Rock Lighthouse established at Warrior Point.\n    * 1930s - The Army Corps of Engineers builds flood-control dikes.\n    * 1940s - Sauvie Island Wildlife Area acquired by the state of Oregon.[4]\n    * November 29, 1943 - Sauvie Island Conservation District is formed by unanimous vote.[5]\n    * December 30, 1950 - Sauvie Island Bridge opens; Sauvie Island Ferry closes.\n    * 2006 - Multnomah County begins construction of new Sauvie Island Bridge.\n    * 2008 - New Sauvie Island Bridge opens.\n	MIxed flood plain and riparian forest; alder and cottonwood		Reeder Beach does not have public beach access. All public beaches on Sauvie Island are down the road from Reeder Beach approximately four miles. They are: Walton Beach, North Unit Beach, and the clothing-optional Collins Beach[6] on the island's east coast along NW Reeder Road's last few miles past the end of the pavement. The beaches are open from dawn to 10:00 p.m., and are closed to overnight use and camping. Open fires are not allowed. Dogs are allowed if they are leashed.\n\nBeach and other parking is subject to Sauvie Island Wildlife Area parking permits.[7] They are available at Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife office and at all the stores on the island. Vehicles without a permit are subject to a ticket costing around $75;\n\nAdditional "Removal of Vegetation Permit" required for mushroom collection.  The permit is free, and (as of 2013) is obtainable from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife office on Sauvie Island in person or by phone.	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauvie_Island
290	1319	1		Bothell (pronounced /ˈbɒθəl/ BOTH-əl) is a city located in King and Snohomish Counties in the state of Washington. It is part of the Seattle metropolitan area. The population was 30,150 at the time of the 2000 census. Prior to annexation and the 2000 census, the northern portions of Bothell which lie in Snohomish County were considered a part of the Alderwood Manor-Bothell North census-designated place.\n\nPrior to European settlement, the Sammamish River Valley from Lake Washington to Issaquah Creek south and upstream of Lake Sammamish was inhabited by a population of as many as 200 native Americans known as the Sammamish. The Sammamish were relocated after the Puget Sound War in 1856 to reservations and non-reservation lands.[3]\n\nIn 1870, Columbus S. Greenleaf and George R. Wilson filed land claims in the area abandoned by the Sammamish near present-day Bothell, and built homes. Eight families followed over the next six years. In 1876, Canadian George Brackett bought land and began commercial logging out of a camp located on the north bank of the Sammamish River in what is now the heart of downtown Bothell. A store, school, and sawmill followed over the next several years.\n\nIn 1885, Brackett sold 80 acres (320,000 m2) to David Bothell, a settler from Pennsylvania. The town's first postmaster, who bought his property from Bothell, named the town in his honor in 1888. Later that same year, a local railroad was built through the town to transport coal from Issaquah. Bothell was officially incorporated on April 14, 1909.[3]\nCountry Village arts mall off the beaten track\n\nBothell continued to grow as logging expanded and boat traffic brought increasing amounts of goods and passengers up and down the river. As more people moved into the area, the Army Corps of Engineers decided to dredge and straighten the river in the years shortly after Bothell's incorporation. Most boat traffic came to an abrupt end only a few years later when Lake Washington was lowered in 1917. Water transport also shifted to trucks after a brick road was built from Seattle. The logging economy declined quickly around the same time, and the local economy shifted to farming.[3]\n\nAfter World War II, better highways and a post-war boom brought suburban development to Bothell. These new neighborhoods and a series of annexations dramatically expanded Bothell's population from about 1000 in 1950 to over 30,000 as of 2006. Bothell was mostly a bedroom community for people working in Seattle until the 1990s when business development brought new jobs to create a regional employment center with about 20,000 jobs, many in high technology sectors such as biotechnology and software development. In 2000, a branch campus of the University of Washington opened in Bothell, co-located with Cascadia Community College.\n\nBothell is located at 47°46′18″N 122°12′16″W﻿ / ﻿47.771670°N 122.204421°W﻿ / 47.771670; -122.204421 (47.771670, -122.204421).[4] The largest river is the Sammamish, which connects Lake Sammamish to Lake Washington.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 12.1 square miles (31.2 km2).None of the area is covered with water.\n\nBothell is a geographical oddity in that it straddles two counties (King County and Snohomish County). Because most streets in Bothell are numbered and not named, this has the unfortunate side-effect of causing all streets that cross the county line to change numbers. For example, 104th Avenue NE in King County becomes 23rd Avenue SE when it crosses into Snohomish County.\n[edit] Neighborhoods\nSammamish River, near downtown Bothell\n\nBothell has several distinct neighborhoods. These include:\n\n    * Canyon Creek is the residential area east of Canyon Park and south of Maltby Road, with two elementary schools Canyon Creek Elementary, and Skyview Junior High School The schools are part of the Northshore School District.\n    * Canyon Park is a commercial and business district at the junction of Bothell-Everett Highway and Interstate 405, with several restaurants, shops, and grocery stores, along with several major employers.\n    * Downtown Bothell, north of Bothell Way on the north side of the Sammamish River, was an area originally settled by pioneers and contains a business district along Main Street, and several blocks of residences at the foot of Beckstrom Hill. It also contains city hall and the police station, the Bothell Library, and Pop Keeney Stadium.\n    * Fitzgerald is a southern extension of Canyon Park containing Canyon Park Junior High.* Juanita is a residential neighborhood along Juanita Way between Wayne Curve and nearby Juanita. Wayne Golf Course is in Juanita.\n    * Lake Pleasant/Country Village is the area bordering the wooded and winding portion of Bothell-Everett Highway between downtown and Canyon Park. Lake Pleasant hosts an RV park, and Country Village is an outdoor shopping center.\n    * Maywood/Beckstrom Hill is a residential neighborhood on the hill north of downtown, and is the location of Maywood Hills Elementary School, Heritage Christian Academy and St. Brendan's Parish School.\n    * North Creek, named for Bothell's second-largest waterway, is a business and light industrial district with several large big box retail stores, and the production facility for the Seattle Times.* Norway Hill is a residential neighborhood overlooking downtown from the south. Most but not all of Norway Hill is outside the official city limits.\n    * Pioneer Hills is a residential community on the hills east of North Creek that borders Woodinville, and contains Woodin Elementary School.\n    * Queensgate is a residential neighborhood along Brickyard Road, south of the Sammamish River and adjacent to nearby Woodinville.\n    * Mays Pond is a residential neighborhood just north of the Bothell's city limits containing Woodside and Cedar Wood Elementary Schools.\n    * Queensborough/Brentwood is a residential neighborhood west and north of Canyon Park, containing Frank Love Elementary School and Wallace Swamp Creek Park.* Riverfront, south of Bothell Way and mostly along the south side of the river near Riverside Drive, contains Sammamish River Park, Blyth Park, several residences, and the Northshore Senior Center.\n    * Shelton View is a residential neighborhood north of Westhill in Snohomish County containing Shelton View Elementary.\n    * Thrasher's Corner is a retail district mostly outside the city limits of Bothell, that along with the residential Red Hawk neighborhood to the east is part of the city's official planning area.\n    * Westhill is a mid-20th century residential expansion on the hill to the west of downtown, and includes Bothell High School and Westhill Elementary School.\n\nPrior to 1993, the nearby city of Woodinville was unincorporated, and some of its neighborhoods were considered part of Bothell and were being considered for annexation. The people of Woodinville voted in 1992 to incorporate, and incorporation was official early the next year.\n[edit] Education\n\nBothell is home to Cascadia Community College and the University of Washington, Bothell, which became a four-year degree-granting institution in the fall of 2006. The two institutions share the same campus, which opened in the year 2000, and are closely linked. After becoming accredited in 2006 Cascadia Community College was named the second best community college in the nation, behind Atlanta Technical College.[5][6][7]\n\nSchools for Bothell students in grades Kindergarten through 12th grade are part of the Northshore School District while private schools include Heritage Christian Academy serving Kindergarten through 9th grades.[8] Schools in Northshore School district include Westhill Elementary, Frank Love Elementary, Maywood Hills Elementary, Canyon Park Junior High School, and Bothell High School.\n[edit] Government and politics\n\nBothell has a Council-manager government governed by a City Council consisting of seven Council Members, each of whom is elected to a four year term. Council elections are held every two years, with either three or four positions standing, depending upon year. All positions are nonpartisan and at-large, elected by the entire city voting population. The Council passes ordinances and resolutions, approves the budget, sets policies and adjudicates issues, and elects from its own membership a Mayor and Deputy Mayor for two year terms.\n\nDay to day affairs in the city are administered by a City Manager appointed by the council.\n\nBothell remains the only municipality in the state of Washington to have two consecutive amputee mayors; James Dixon (who lacked a right leg) from 1956 to 1960, followed by Monty Winestein (left arm) from 1960 to 1963.\n[edit] Culture\n[edit] Civic events\nFreedom Festival 2005\n\nMajor annual events throughout the year in Bothell include:\n\n    * The City of Bothell Freedom Festival, a two-day festival celebrating American Independence, including an annual Fourth of July parade and a reenactment of the Battle of Concord on the Bothell Landing Bridge.\n    * The Music in the Park concert series, every Friday in July and August at Bothell Landing Amphitheater.\n    * Greater Bothell Arts & Crafts Fair\n    * City of Bothell Riverfest\n    * The Summits of Bothell bike ride[9]\n    * La Fiesta Viva!, a celebration of Latino cultural heritage, at Country Village.\n    * Harvest Festival and Pumpkin Carving, at Country Village.\n    * Tree Lighting and Santa Arrival, at Bothell Landing.\n\n[edit] Sports\n\nBothell's Pop Keeney Stadium hosts games for several local high schools, including Inglemoor, Woodinville, and Bothell High Schools\n\nIn November 2006, Bothell High School's football team tied the national record for most overtime periods (9) in a quarter-final game against Pasco, which they won 43-40. The previous record was set in Michigan in 1977, between Southeastern (Detroit) and Northeastern, with Southeastern winning, 42-36. The team also had its first appearance in the state finals later that same season, which resulted in defeat to Oak Harbor High School.[citation needed]\n\nThe Bothell hockey club won the Washington High School Hockey League D2 State Championship in 2006 and 2007.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007 the Bothell High School baseball team made it to state playing at Safeco Field. They recorded a 4th place finish.\n\nIn 2009 George and the Bothell Alumni club raised money to get a state of the art scoreboard for Pop Keeney Stadium. In 2009 it was installed, only the 2nd in the state of Washington of its type.\n\nBothell High School's football team has made it to the 4A State Championship at the Tacoma Dome twice but has failed to bring back the trophy each time losing both games 21-14.\n\nIn August 2009, the Ruiz-Costie/Northshore Pool was mothballed pending a new operator. A new aquatic center may replace it, as part of Bothell's core redevelopment.\n\nIn February 2006, Bothell High School's gymnastics team won the 4A State Championships, topping off an undefeated season.\n[edit] Popular culture\n\nIn December 1962, LIFE Magazine recognized Bothell's 112-foot (34 m) Christmas tree as the largest living Christmas tree in the world. However, in the late 1970s, disease attacked the tree, and the top had to be removed.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1996 Seattle rock documentary "Hype!", photographer Charles Peterson recalls that when he was growing up in Bothell the sign welcoming people to the town read "Welcome to Bothell, for a day or a lifetime," and an unknown person spray-painted over the "Bot" so that the sign would read "Welcome to hell, for a day or a lifetime."[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, about 5,000 to 7,000 people gathered for a parade and outdoor concert at the Veterans Memorial Amphitheater at Bothell Landing in honor of local American Idol contestant Blake Lewis.[10]\n\n\n[edit] Demographics\nHistorical populations\nCensus \tPop. \t\t%±\n1910 \t599 \t\t\n—\n1920 \t613 \t\t2.3%\n1930 \t818 \t\t33.4%\n1940 \t794 \t\t−2.9%\n1950 \t1,019 \t\t28.3%\n1960 \t2,237 \t\t119.5%\n1970 \t4,883 \t\t118.3%\n1980 \t7,943 \t\t62.7%\n1990 \t12,345 \t\t55.4%\n2000 \t30,150 \t\t144.2%\nEst. 2009 \t32,959 \t\t9.3%\n\nAs of the census[1] of 2000, there were 30,150 people, 11,923 households, and 7,928 families residing in the city.

292	1323	1		Edmonds is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. Edmonds has a view of Puget Sound and both the Olympic Mountains and Cascade Range. The population was 39,515 at the 2000 census; according to 2006 estimates, Edmonds was the second most populous city in Snohomish County, ranking only behind Everett.[3] Based on per capita income, one of the more reliable measures of affluence, Edmonds ranks 37th of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked.\n\nEdmonds is a port in the Washington State Ferries system. Currently, the only ferry from Edmonds is a run to Kingston, Washington; in the past, there have been much longer routes from Edmonds to Port Townsend, Washington.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nEdmonds is the oldest incorporated city in Snohomish County. Logger George Brackett founded Edmonds in 1890, naming the city either for Vermont Sen. George Franklin Edmunds[5] or in association with the nearby Point Edmund, named by Charles Wilkes in 1841 and later changed to Point Edwards.[6] Brackett came to the future site of Edmonds while paddling a canoe north of Seattle, searching for timber. When a gust of wind hit his canoe, Brackett beached in a location later called "Brackett's Landing".[7]\n\nThe town was named Edmonds in 1884, but was not incorporated until 1890 as an official “village fourth class” of Snohomish County. In that same year, Brackett sold 455 acres (1.84 km2) to the Minneapolis Realty and Investment Company. The town was plotted and a wharf was added along the waterfront. Modest houses and commercial structures sprouted up with a row of shingle mills dominating the cityscape.\n\nIn 1891, the Great Northern Railway came through and early settlers and investors grew hopeful that Edmonds would prosper. Unfortunately, the Panic of 1893 created business setbacks and the town owners foreclosed. Brackett reclaimed his town and along with other early settlers continued to develop its infrastructure. By 1900 there was regular passenger ferry service available by the steam-powered “mosquito fleet” of private ferryboats from Edmonds to Seattle.\n\nEdmonds suffered major fires in 1909 and 1928, and many buildings were lost. The first car arrived in Edmonds in 1911. As more roads were established, Edmonds experienced steady growth along with commercial and residential development.[citation needed]\n[edit] Historic Sites\n\nThe Edmonds South Snohomish Historical Society resides in the city's only National Historic Place - the old Carnegie Library of Edmonds.[8] Located on 5th Ave, it was built in 1900 to serve as a library and education building. It now serves as the Edmonds Historical Museum.\n[edit] The Edmonds Fountain/Gazebo\nThe Edmonds fountain.\n\nThe Edmonds fountain, a local landmark, has been a source of major local contention over the past decades. The current Edmonds Fountain is located in the center of the roundabout at the intersection of 5th Avenue and Main St. Until 1970, every holiday season the Edmonds municipal Christmas tree stood on this spot, but in 1970 the original fountain, an obscure twisted sculpture incorporating a fountain, was erected. That fountain and sculpture were wrecked in 1998 by a drunk driver. The city council and subsequent "Gazebo" subcommittee decided to rebuild. The gazebo was rebuilt a year later, reinforced with stronger wood supports. In 2005, a driver crashed into the gazebo at night.[9] After a long discussion over to rebuild or landscape the center of the roundabout, a decision was made to rebuild the gazebo/fountain, this time with steel rods extending from the main pillars deep underground. It was completed in the summer of 2006.\n[edit] Demographics\nHistorical populations\nCensus \tPop. \t\t%±\n1900 \t474 \t\t\n—\n1910 \t1,114 \t\t135.0%\n1920 \t936 \t\t−16.0%\n1930 \t1,165 \t\t24.5%\n1940 \t1,288 \t\t10.6%\n1950 \t2,057 \t\t59.7%\n1960 \t8,016 \t\t289.7%\n1970 \t23,998 \t\t199.4%\n1980 \t27,679 \t\t15.3%\n1990 \t30,743 \t\t11.1%\n2000 \t39,515 \t\t28.5%\nEst. 2009 \t40,773 \t\t3.2%\n\nAs of the census[1] of 2000, there were 39,515 people, 16,904 households, and 10,818 families residing in the city.

Within the city limits of Edmonds, there is one high school (Edmonds-Woodway) and six primary schools (Chase Lake, Edmonds, Seaview, Sherwood, Westgate, and Woodway). In addition, Edmonds is served by two K-8 schools; Maplewood and Madrona.[11]\n\nIn 1990, Edmonds High School merged with Woodway High School to form Edmonds-Woodway High School, which is currently one of only eight schools in the state to host an IB Diploma Programme.[12][13]\n[edit] Recreation\nThe Edmonds Marina.\n\nEdmonds hosts a variety of parks, including a dog park, a small skate park, and the Edmonds Underwater Park.\n\nIn addition, Edmonds has one of the largest marine facilities in Snohomish County, the Port of Edmonds. The marina is partly artificial, being dredged to a depth of 13 feet (4.0 m), and can house 948 craft (668 in the water, and 280 in dry storage).[14]\n[edit] The arts\n\nIn 2006, the Edmonds Center for the Arts was opened.[15] This is one of two current theaters available for general performing arts, the other being the theater at Edmonds-Woodway High School.\n[edit] Drama\n\nEdmonds has one permanent, privately-funded drama group, The Driftwood Players. Their theater, the Wade James Theatre, is located at 950 Main St., adjacent to Yost Park. Usually, they have 4-5 main performances per season, supplemented with short, one night plays. They have been present in the community since 1957.[16]\n[edit] Edmonds Arts Festival\nThe Otter Chimera\n\nSince 1957, Edmonds has annually hosted the Edmonds Arts Festival, a three-day art exhibit, on Father's Day weekend.[17][18][19] The festival is especially noted for painting and drawing. The festival is heavily involved with local schools, devoting several galleries to student artwork.[20]\n[edit] Edmonds Jazz Connection\n\nEvery year the Edmonds Rotary sponsors the Edmonds Jazz Connection festival, on Memorial Day Weekend in May. During the day, the festival showcases the best of school-age and high school jazz groups, and the evening show features prominent, professional jazz musicians. The event is a large draw for both local and regional audiences.\n[edit] Frances Anderson Center\n\nThe Frances Anderson Center, located on Main Street, serves as a central hub for many activities in the city. It contains sports facilities, child-care programs, art classes, and is directly adjacent to the Edmonds Library. The Edmonds Arts Festival is also held at the Frances Anderson Center.\n[edit] Periodicals\n\nThe Edmonds community is home to two weekly news publications, the Edmonds Enterprise and the Edmonds Beacon. The opinion pages of these two newspapers have had major influence on city council decisions, building code enforcement, dog park rule enforcement and local elections. The mayor writes a column each week in both papers, usually responding to current issues, citizen concerns, and planned city projects. An archive of all articles written by the mayor is found on the city website.\n[edit] Farmer's Market\n\nThe Edmond's Museum Summer Market, sponsored by the Edmond's-South Snohomish County Historical Society, is held each Saturday from May to September.

294	1326	1		Ha Ha Tonka State Park is a state park in Missouri, United States, located near Camdenton on the Niangua arm of the Lake of the Ozarks. The area has several caves, sinkholes, and bluffs overlooking the lake. The most notable feature of the park is the stone ruins of a mansion, called "the castle", which burned down in 1942. The state purchased the property for the park which opened in 1978.\n\nThere is an observation point across from the Post Office where one can view the "castle" and the water tower which was repaired in 2004, with a new roof installed. The state park is on a road used by locals to commute to work and the speed can be high; for the safety of visitors there are hiking trails to get to the caves and the castle, and walking on the road is not recommended.\n\nThe band Ha Ha Tonka (previously Amsterband) is named after the park.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ha_Ha_Tonka_State_Park

298	425	1		Saint-Genis-Pouilly is a commune in the Ain department in eastern France.\n\nIt is located in the Pays de Gex, at the foot of the Jura. Bordering the Swiss frontier, it is part of the cross-border area of Geneva. Because of its population, it is one of the ten most important towns in the department of Ain.[1] Its inhabitants are known as Saint-genésiens.\n\nA large portion of CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, is located in the territory of Saint-Genis-Pouilly. CERN is one of the top locations in the world for fundamental research and it is the presence of CERN that has been responsible for the development of the community since the middle of the 1960s.\n\nGeography\n\nSaint-Genis-Pouilly is composed of two market towns (Saint-Genis and Pouilly) and two hamlets (Pregnin and Flies). The two market towns have both continued to expand and now practically merge together into one, however the two hamlets still remain separate from each other and from the two towns. The altitude of the commune varies from 419 m (at the extreme south of the commune, to the confluence of the rivers Allandon and Nant de l'Ecra) at 502 m (at the extreme north of the commune, in the village of Flies). The commune is situated at the limit between the plain and the first rising of the Jura. As indicated on the map opposite, the communes surrounding Saint-Genis-Pouilly are: Thoiry, Sergy, Crozet, Chevry, Prévessin-Moëns and Dardagny (Swiss).\nCommunes bordering Saint-Genis-Pouilly\n[edit] Hydrology\n\nMany water courses traverse or border Saint-Genis-Pouilly: Lion, Allondon, Nant de l'Ecra, Bief de la Janvoin, Ouaf, Grand Journans and Petit Journans. In 2005 and 2006, these water courses were subject to a ban on water extraction as a result of the drought. In 2004, only the Allandon and the Lion would have been restricted.[2] The depth of the Allandon is measured at Saint-Genis-Pouilly by a network HYDRO station which transmits these readings by telephone.[3]\n[edit] Climate\n\nThe meteorological station situated at Geneva International Airport, Cointrin, furnishes measurements of the weather relevant to Saint-Genis-Pouilly. This station is situated only 6.5 km from the centre of the commune and at a similar altitude (420m).[4] Data from this station is available in real time from MétéoSuisse.\n\nSaint-Genis-Pouilly, like the whole of the Pays de Gex and the Canton of Geneva, knows the touch of the Joran, the cold wind which descends towards Lac Léman from the high Jura, where it sometimes provokes a storm.\n[edit] Natural risks\n\nAccording to a study [5] made in 2002, commissioned by the Department of Agriculture and the Forests of Ain, Saint-Genis-Pouilly is classed in a zone at risk from flooding. According to another official publication,[6] the commune is classed in a zone at risk from torrential downpours and rapid flooding. However, according to the list of major risks [7] to Saint-Genis-Pouilly published on the portal of the website of the Ministry of Ecology, “Prevention of major risks”, the commune is classed in a zone at risk from overcrowding from man’s activities. These three different qualifications of risk cannot be explained.\n\nAlong with the other communes in the canton of Gex, Saint-Genis-Pouilly is classed in seismic zone Ib, which is to say that the seismic risk is low.[8] A new classification is being prepared by the Ministry of Ecology,[9] but it does not seem that this will significantly change the classification of the communes in the Pays de Gex.\n[edit] Nature zones\n\nThat part of the Allandon valley which is found within the territory of the commune constitutes a natural zone with interesting ecology, fauna and flora (ZNIEFF type I).[10]\n\nThe commune is lightly wooded (the area occupied by trees is between 10 and 20%[11]).\n[edit] History\n\nIt was in 1887 that the actual name, Saint-Genis-Pouilly, first appeared on the State civil registers. Previously, Saint-Genis-Pouilly was called Pouilly-Saint-Genis. Before that, the two towns were separately identified. The spelling Saint-Genix had been quite frequently used. Pouilly was a little Roman city which probably took its name from the Latin Appolliacum.\n\nIn his historical Atlas, G. Debombourg placed Pulliacum in the epoque of the second reign of the Bourgogne (879-1032) and he placed the church of Pouilly-St-Genis on the religious maps.[12] In these "Preuves" he cites a text of 993 which mentions Pulliacum.[13]\n\nA diary of 1698 mentions a certain Balthazard as a noble of Prengin, in the Pays de Gex (perhaps this is the name given during this epoque to the current hamlet of Pregnin). Between 1601 and 1789 mention is made of the Baronnie of Saint-Genist. [14]\n\nNames of the area with a Gallo-Romanic origin, Polliacum, Pulliacum, derived, with the suffix -acum from the root name Paulius or Pollius[15].\n\nIt is probable that under the Roman occupation the church in the village was to be dedicated to Apollon.\n\nTowards the end of this time, Saint Genis took on a greater importance. Its takeover of the Postes Royales (next to the current chapel) commenced the growth of the town and Pouilly-Saint-Genix became Saint-Genis-Pouilly.\n\nPregnin figures in the Procès-verbaux du Directoire[16]. The name of Saint-Genis, as in the case of Saint-Genis-Laval, probably comes from Saint-Genest, a Roman comedian from the second half of the IIIe century, martryed under Dioclétien.[17]\n[edit] Roman period\n\nThe Roman colony Colonia Iulia Equestris founded by Julius Caesar between 50 et 45 BC extended as far as Thoiry and included the territory which was to become Saint-Genis-Pouilly.\n\nThe villa of Pouilly had been occupied by a rich family, as evidenced by the jewelry found there.[18]\n\nThe place called les châtelets, situated to the north of Pregnin took its name, without doubt, from the presence in the 2nd century of a small fort situated on the Roman road running along the Jura.[19]\n[edit] Middle Ages\n\nA priory was established at Pouilly at the end of the 10th century.[20]\n\nIn 1301, Uldric, the Seigneur of Saint-Genis renewed his allegiance to the Dauphin.[21]\n[edit] 18th century\n\nThe map of ancient Geneva by Cassini, with the measurements taken by Calon de Felcourt between 1759 and 1761, shows the town of Pouilly, the hamlets of Pregnin and Flies, and also the windmill at St Genis can be identified. The road from Lyon to Geneva and the fork towards Gex are also clearly visible. These roads, easily identifiable by the route they trace through the Pays de Gex, still exist today.\n[edit] Notable events\n\nA few (albeit rather rare) events in the history of the commune :\nYear \tEvent\n 1590  \tThe château of Pouilly was destroyed by order of the Conseils.[22]\n 1591  \tThe Spanish army of Don Olivaros sacked the Pays de Gex with sword and fire.[23]\n 1601  \tWith the whole of the Pays de Gex, Saint-Genis-Pouilly was reattached to France.\nRestoral of the fiefdom of Saint-Genix by Françoise of Lambert.[24]\n 1662  \tThe Protestant temple of Pouilly was destroyed on 30 November by order of the Evêque of Geneva.[25]\n 1722  \tThe Seigneurie of Saint-Genix was ceded to the Evêque and the Prince of Geneva.[26]\n 1887  \tFirst mention of Saint-Genis-Pouilly as the name of the commune.\n[edit] Today\n\nIt was the extension within France of CERN (The European Organization for Nuclear Research), in the middle of the sixties, which made Saint-Genis-Pouilly the little town “coquette”[27] that it is today. It is also thanks to the presence of CERN that the local economy has considerably increased and diversified.\n[edit] Coat of arms\n\nUntil recently, the commune used an azure coat of arms with three gold towers. Today, the commune uses exclusively a modern logo which figures prominently on the pages of its Web site and in its publications.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Genis-Pouilly

300	1330	1		Northgate is an informal district of neighborhoods in north urban Seattle, Washington, named for and surrounding Northgate Mall, the first covered mall in the United States.[1] Its east-west principal arterials are NE Northgate Way and 130th Street, and its north-south principal arterials are Roosevelt Way NE and Aurora Avenue N (SR 99). Minor arterials are College Way-Meridian Avenue N, 1st, 5th, and 15th avenues NE.[2] Interstate 5 runs through the district. Besides the eponymous mall, the most characteristic distinctions of the area are North Seattle Community College (NSCC), the south fork of the Thornton Creek watershed, and the Sheihk Idriss Mosque.\n\nMosque\nIdriss Mosque\n\nThe Sheihk Idriss Mosque in Pinehurst has architecture unique in Seattle. An octagonal dome and a symbolic minaret, both sheathed in copper and capped with crescent moons, red brick walls banded with buff brick and tall glass-block windows topped with concrete lintels in the shape of Moorish arches distinguish the first mosque in Seattle (1981) and the first mosque west of the Mississippi River to be built in a Middle Eastern design.[4]\n[edit] Mall\n\nThe Northgate Mall, opened in 1950, is the first regional shopping center called a mall, though there are 3 other shopping centers in the United States which predate it. [1] At the time of its opening, it was located outside of the Seattle city limits, though this is no longer the case. It is located in the Maple Leaf neighborhood of Northgate. [5]\n\nSurrounding Northgate Mall are many strip malls and the "Northgate North" shopping center which features a Best Buy and a 2 level Target.\n[edit] Development\n\nThe Northgate area has been subject to a large amount of residential and commercial development in the last few years, and many huge projects are underway. The height limits in the area have been increased to 85' to allow for further population growth.\n\nIn 2006, a new park, library, and community center opened in the Northgate neighborhood across 5th Ave NE from Northgate Mall. These are part of the city's plan to accelerate development in Northgate. [6]\n\nWhile there is much commerce in the area, hotel development has been limited with only the Hotel Nexus, previously a Ramada Inn, being the only upscale hotel in the area. The many motels on Aurora Avenue is further northwest than the Northgate neighborhood.\n[edit] Prehistory\n\nWhat is now Northgate has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 B.C.E.—10,000 years ago). The Dkhw’Duw’Absh, People of the Inside and Xacuabš, People of the Large Lake, Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish native people had used the Liq'tid Springs area as a spiritual health spa. They harvested cranberries from the Slo’q `qed (SLOQ-qed, bald head), an 85 acre (34 ha) marsh and bog at what is now the NSCC car park, Interstate 5 interchange, and Northgate Mall. Large open areas for game habitat and foraging (anthropogenic grasslands) were maintained in what are now these neighborhoods by selective burning every few years. Today the Native American descendents are represented by the Duwamish Tribe.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northgate,_Seattle
301	1332	1		The Mingo National Wildlife Refuge is a 21,676 acre (87.7 km²) National Wildlife Refuge located in northwestern Stoddard and southeastern Wayne counties in Missouri. Its southwesternmost portion lies on the shores of Lake Wappapello. Named after the Mingo tribe, it was established to preserve bottomland hardwoods as well as provide waterfowl and other migratory birds in the Mississippi Flyway with nesting, feeding, brooding, and resting habitat.\n\nThe refuge is maintained with a nine person staff with a fiscal year 2004 budget of $1.2 million.\n\nIn 1804, the Louisiana Purchase acquired this territory for the United States. At that time, the population of the entire Bootheel was sparse and the swamp area was considered inaccessible. When Missouri became a state in 1821, all of the counties in southeast Missouri had settlers, except Stoddard and Dunklin counties, although Cape Girardeau was one of the most important river towns in Missouri.\n\nSettlers first came to the swamp because of the vast cypress and tupelo forests. The giant cypress trees were the first to be used for railroad ties and building lumber. The T.J. Moss Tie Company was a large Bootheel lumbering operation, with its headquarters in Puxico, Missouri. By 1888, T.J. Moss was the largest tie contractor in the state, and many of their ties were cut from trees taken from the swamp. A large mill was operated just north of Puxico on land now within Mingo NWR. Local sources claim that, at one time, the mill was the largest bandsaw mill in America. The lumber industry reached peak production in the Bootheel between 1900 and 1910. During its peak, the Bootheel was consistently the leading lumber-producing area of Missouri. However, by 1935 most of the large operations had ceased. The giant trees were cut and it was necessary to find lumber in other places.\n\nThe powerful and wealthy lumber companies had not lost interest in the Bootheel yet. If the land could be drained it would again become an important source of revenue. The size of the projects remained small because of the expanse involved. The lumber companies had considerable capital to invest, but demanded large grants of land for the drainage and were frequently more interested in the land than in efficiency of their drainage ditches. The Missiouri State Legislature passed an act that allowed the formation of drainage districts, financed by long-term bonds. For the first time, drainage projects could be adequately financed and many drainage districts were created in the Bootheel.\n\nIn 1914, more than 20 drainage districts existed in Stoddard County. One of them was the Mingo Drainage District, a small district in the Advance Lowlands near Puxico. More than $1 million was spent to make Mingo Swamp suitable for farming. A system of seven major north-south ditches was constructed to drain water from the swamp into the St. Francis River, about 10 miles (16 km) south of Puxico. Except for the narrow southern extension of the district south of Puxico, the District's boundary and the Mingo NWR boundary are essentially the same. The ditches constructed by the district are used today by the refuge for water control and management.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, land values plummeted and many of the large landholders (lumber companies) defaulted on payment of taxes rather than continue to maintain unprofitable investments in the land. Throughout the Bootheel, many drainage districts were unable to meet financial obligations and defaulted on bond payments, largely because they couldn't absorb the loss of revenue created by the large landholders. Mingo District was one of these.\n\nDrainage attempts at Mingo had not been completely successful, at least in part because of the overflow from the St. Francis River. Also, the soil was not as productive as in other areas of the Bootheel. During the 1930s, Mingo District became insolvent.\n\nThe remaining timber was cut by anyone without regard to ownership. The area was open range country. Cattle and hogs ran over the entire swamp. To maintain it in a grassy condition, the land was burned, often several times a year. Hogs and cattle became so numerous that they overflowed into the small towns near the swamp.\n\nIndiscriminate shooting of waterfowl was common. Other wildlife species were also not faring so well. Beaver and deer had disappeared and the wild turkey were nearly extinct from the swamp.\n\nIn 1945, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service purchased 21,676 acres (87.7 km²) of the Mingo Swamp and established the Mingo NWR. The condition of the land was deplorable. In the previous 50 years, man had reduced a beautiful swamp, lush with the growth of plants and alive with animals, into a burnt and eroded wasteland.\n\nThrough careful management, most of the natural plants and animals were restored. Native trees have replaced much of the brush and briers, and a canoe trip down the Mingo River will now reveal little to the casual observer of the abuses to this land in years past. Deer, wild turkey, bobcat and beaver have returned and are plentiful. The refuge is now able to accomplish its primary objective; providing food and shelter for migratory waterfowl. The establishment of the Mingo Wilderness Area in 1976 helps ensure this protection for future generations of Americans.\n[edit] Topography\n\nApproximately, 25,000 years ago the Mississippi River ran between the Ozark Mountains and Crowley's Ridge. Then, approximately 18,000 years ago, the river shifted, slicing its way through Crowley's Ridge to join the Ohio River further north. The abandoned river bed developed into a rich and fertile swamp.\n\nThe Refuge lies in a basin formed in an ancient abandoned channel of the Mississippi River, bordered on the west by the foothills of the Ozark Mountains, and on the east by a terrace called Crowley’s Ridge.\n\nThe refuge contains the only remaining large tract of bottomland forest of 15,000 acres (61 km²) from the original 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²) native to the bootheel of Missouri. There are seven natural areas and 99 archaeological sites.\n\nApproximately 8000 acres (32 km²) of land are contained in the Mingo Wilderness. Additionally, the 6,190 acre (25 km²) Missouri Department of Conservation, Duck Creek Conservation Area, [1], joins the refuge on the north and east boundary.\n[edit] Wildlife and protected species\nMingo NWR\n\nMingo's primary goal is to protect wilderness resources and critical habitat for migratory waterfowl. Located in the center of one of the busy Mississippi Flyway, the refuge serves as an important resting and feeding area for migratory birds heading south.\n\nIn addition to resident waterfowl species, Mingo provides for migrating ducks, geese, shorebirds, gulls, terns, loons, grebes, pelicans, cormorants, herons, bitterns, ibises, rails, coots and swans. There are over 95 species of migratory waterfowl that have been seen at Mingo. Through year-round management of the water levels on the refuge, the feeding and resting requirements of migrating birds can be met. The refuge provides wintering habitat for over 150,000 ducks and 75,000 geese\n\nMingo also provides for other types of migratory and non-migratory avian species. Over 250 species of birds have been seen at Mingo. Included in this list are the peregrine falcon, endangered whooping crane and threatened bald eagle.\n\nIn addition to migratory birds, Mingo provides year-round habitat for a variety of other species. Due to the diverse habitat, Mingo is home for a wide variety of lowland swamp species and upland forest and field species. Mingo is home to over 38 species of mammals, 23 species of amphibians and 37 species of reptiles. Due to wilderness protection and inaccessibility to many areas of the refuge, mammals, amphibians and reptiles are abundant but seldom seen, remaining for the most part unspoiled by man's influence.\n[edit] Facilities\n\nWildlife Observation and Photography are welcomed at the refuge. Twelve miles of refuge roadway are open daily, providing four observation overlooks and one boardwalk nature trail. A twenty-five-mile, scenic, seasonal auto tour route is open throughout April and May to view spring wildflowers and spring songbird migration and October and November for the fall foilage and waterfowl migration.\n\nLimited hunting for deer, wild turkey, squirrel, and waterfowl is available in designated areas of the refuge. Fishing for bass, crappie, bluegill, and catfish is a popular activity on the refuge.\n\nTrails\nA section of boardwalk trail leads to an observation platform.\n\nThe refuge has three designated trails along with 50 miles (80 km) of unmarked trails:\n[edit] Boardwalk Nature Trail\n\nThe Boardwalk Nature Trail allows visitors to enjoy the beauty of Mingo swamp without getting wet. Down this path lies a one mile (1.6 km) loop trail through the bottomland hardwood swamp. A self-guided pamphlet of the trail is available at the Boardwalk parking lot. The path is wheelchair accessible.\n[edit] Bluff Trail\n\nThe 1/4 mile Bluff Trail begins at the Visitor Center and connects with the Boardwalk. It provides a fascinating hike when wildflowers are blooming in the spring. It also furnishes an interesting view of the steep limestone bluffs bordering the swamp that once was the mighty Mississippi River. This trail is rated "challenging" for hikers.\n[edit] Hartz Pond Trail\n\nThe Hartz Pond Trail begins in the Visitor Center parking lot and leads you to Hartz Pond, a small pond with a picnic table and fishing opportunities for the kids. Hartz Pond is also used an outdoor classroom for environmental education classes.\n[edit] Other hiking areas\n\nIn addition to the three trails listed above, Mingo has over 50 miles (80 km) of hiking opportunities on other refuge roads, dikes, and levees that are not open to vehicular traffic. These areas are open to foot traffic from March 15 through September 30. Visitors should contact the Visitor Center before venturing out for directions and special regulations that may apply.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingo_National_Wildlife_Refuge

306	1352	4	Wikipedia	Volunteer Park is a 48.3 acre (195,000 m²) park in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, USA.\n\nVolunteer Park was acquired by the city of Seattle for $2,000 in 1876 from J.M. Colman. In 1885 it was designated a cemetery, but two years later it was named "Lake View Park," and the cemetery was developed on an adjacent plot of land (see Lake View Cemetery). The park then became known as "City Park." In 1901, it was renamed "Volunteer Park" to honor the volunteers who served in the Spanish-American War. J. Willis Sayre, a Seattle theatre critic, journalist, and historian, who had fought in the war, had actively lobbied local officials to rename this park. From 1904 to 1909, the Olmsted Brothers prepared formal plans for the park.[1].\n[edit] Features\n\nThe park includes a conservatory (a designated city landmark[2]), completed in 1912; a water tower with an observation deck; a fenced-off reservoir; the dramatic Art deco building of the Seattle Asian Art Museum (a designated city landmark[3]); a statue of William H. Seward; and a sculpture, Black Sun, by Isamu Noguchi (colloquially referred to as "The Doughnut") around which a scenic view of the Seattle skyline that prominently includes the Space Needle can be seen, as well as several meadows and picnic tables. The wading pool is operational in the summer months and operated daily from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n[edit] Events\n\nSeattle's annual Pride parade used to end at Volunteer Park, where the crowd met various musical guests, sponsoring organizations, and vendors. In 2006, the Parade was relocated to Downtown and the Pride Festival was moved to the Seattle Center, home of the Space Needle. The park also hosts various free concerts and outdoor theater events throughout the summer.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_Park_%28Seattle%29
307	1357	4	Wikipedia	Deep River (2006 population: 4216 [1]) is a town in Renfrew County, Ontario, Canada. Located along the Ottawa River, it lies about 200 kilometers (124 mi) north-west of Ottawa on the Trans-Canada Highway. Deep River is opposite the Laurentian Mountains and the Province of Quebec.\n\nThe primary industry centres around research at the Chalk River Nuclear Research Laboratory, in nearby Chalk River, Ontario, a facility of the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited.\n\nChalk River is about 10km south of Deep River down High Way 17E\n\nTechnically, the plant belongs to the municipality of Deep River. Property taxes make up the majority of Deep River's budget.\n\nPlans for the construction of this planned community began in 1944 by the federal government as part of the Manhattan Project, to accommodate employees of the nearby Chalk River Nuclear Research Laboratories. Along with Los Alamos, New Mexico and Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Chalk River was an offshoot of the nuclear effort for the allies and scientists, engineers, and tradesmen from around the world who came to work on the Manhattan project. After World War II, Canada continued on with research into the atom, and dedicated the country to the peaceful uses that could be derived from putting the atom to use. Deep River was situated far enough upwind and upriver of the Chalk River research reactors to avoid radioactive fallout.\n\nJohn Bland, an architecture professor at McGill University, developed the town's first master plan in 1944. Bland located the town between the existing Highway 17 and the Ottawa River. He designed a system of streets which generally followed the contours of the area's topography. Residential neighborhoods stretched out from a commercial and service-sector core. Straight and broad avenues ran along contour lines, while narrower and winding streets lay at right angles, discouraging non-local traffic from entering neighborhoods. Parks and schools were scattered strategically throughout the town. The streets were named after local flora, Canadian politicians and famous scientists such as Rutherford and Darwin.[2]\n\nAt the same time, its economy and development was further boosted by the construction of the Des Joachim Hydroelectric Generating Station and dam on the Ottawa River at Rolphton, which opened on June 28, 1950.[3]\n\nThe town was the subject of a famous Maclean's Magazine article in 1958 by the noted Canadian journalist, editor, and author Peter C. Newman. Entitled, "Deep River: Almost the Perfect Place to Live,"[4] the article took a sardonic take on the town as a very odd and isolated place populated by mostly young, highly educated and bored scientists and technicians struggling to find things to do with their time: "The Utopian town where our atomic scientists live and play has no crime, no slums, no unemployment and few mothers-in-law."\n[edit] Geography\nMarina on the Ottawa River.\n\nDeep River is located at a latitude of 46°06' north and longitude 77°30' west, in the Boreal Forest biozone, and has an area of 50.87 square kilometres. The town sits on the section of the Ottawa River referred to as "La Rivière Creuse" (the "Deep River") by 17th-century French explorers, and which later was at the heart of Canada's 19th-century timber trade.\n[edit] Recreation, arts and culture\n\nDeep River boasts many active clubs[5]. Among the numerous community accomplishments is the creation of the Deep River Symphony Orchestra, formed in 1951, making Deep River one of the smallest towns to have a symphony orchestra. Cross-country skiing is a popular winter recreation. Avid skiers of the [6] created the Silver Spoon trails and an annual race that brings contestants from across Ontario. Another popular event is Summerfest, a festival held once every two years, hosting many local and famous artists including Sloan, Wide Mouth Mason, Amanda Wilkinson, Daniel Lanois, and Mobile. The festival also organizes many recreational events including the Cross-River Swim. Deep River is generally known to have picturesque scenery, excellent boating along the broad river, and good hiking in the hills across the Ottawa River. Deep River also has a community pool, fire department, ski hill, golf course, curling rink, yacht club, and a library, as well as the Canadian Clock Museum.\n[edit] Education\n\nDeep River is home to four schools, for students from Junior Kindergarten through Grade 12:\n\n    * T.W. Morison Public School [1] - for students JK to grade 6. As decided by the school board on October 26, 2009, Morison Public School will be closed down and moved into Mackenzie High School for the 2011-2012 school year in favour of making Mackenzie a JK-12 "education centre."\n    * Keys Public School [2] - no longer "exists", it used to house students grade 5 to grade 8. At the end of the 2004-2005 school year, Keys Public School was officially closed down due to budget cuts in the school board. The Junior half of Keys (grades 5 and 6) was moved to Morison Public School, and the Intermediate half (grades 7 and 8) joined Mackenzie, separated by name only (though Mackenzie students are not allowed in the Keys Wing). It was predicted Morison would close down at the end of the 2006-2007 school year (for same above mentioned reasons) and would join Mackenzie High School as well, but was delayed in a decision to close until October 2009. The Keys Public School building was rented by AECL (Atomic Energy Canada Limited) for use as an office building. There have since been small changes to the building such as new fences, change in parking, security cameras and codes and badge scanners for doors.\n    * Mackenzie High School [3] - for students grades 9 to 12 (building now houses Keys Public School)\n    * St. Mary's Catholic School [4] - for students JK to grade 8\n\nEvery summer, many top-grade university students and high-school students participate in numerous science projects organized by Deep River Science Academy in cooperation with many of the knowledge-economy enterprises of the area.\n[edit] Media\n\nDeep River's weekly, The North Renfrew Times[7], has been published by the Deep River Community Association[8] since the Town's earliest days.\n[edit] Radio\n\nDeep River is served by a low-power AM repeater of Ottawa's CBC Radio station, CBO-FM:\n\n    * 1110 AM - CBLI, CBC Radio One\n\nAll other stations that may be heard in Deep River broadcast from Pembroke, Ontario. See radio stations in the Ottawa Valley Region and Quebec.\n[edit] Movies\n\nDeep River has achieved a degree of notoriety in the films of David Lynch. As well as being referenced in Blue Velvet, the town is specifically mentioned in Mulholland Drive, Lynch's surreal film about a young actress struggling to cope in Hollywood. Naomi Watts plays a character named Betty at the beginning of the film.\n“ \tBetty: "I just came here from Deep River, Ontario, and now I'm in this ... dream place. You can imagine how I feel." \t”\n\nDEEP RIVER is also the hometown of Director Ben Bachelder, whom in 2008, shot a zombie film in and around the town of Deep River. Conveniently titled, "DEEP RIVER:The Island", see trailer, http://il.youtube.com/watch?v=wy_lSDHW6WU.\n\nAs of now, the film is traveling film festivals across North America, and seeking distribution world wide.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_River,_Ontario

309	43	4	Wikipedia	Lake Crescent is a deep lake located entirely within Olympic National Park in Clallam County, Washington, United States, approximately 17 miles (27 km) west of Port Angeles, Washington on U.S. Route 101 and nearby to the small community of Piedmont. At an official maximum depth of 624 feet (190 m), it is officially the second deepest lake in Washington, although unofficial depth measurements of more than 1,000 feet (300 m) have been recorded.\n\nLake Crescent is known for its brilliant blue waters and exceptional clarity, caused by a lack of nitrogen in the water which inhibits the growth of algae. It is located in a popular recreational area which is home to a number of trails, including the Spruce Railroad Trail, Pyramid Peak trail, and the Barnes Creek trail to Marymere Falls. The Spruce Railroad Trail follows the grade of what was once the tracks of a logging railroad along the shores of the lake. Following this trail on the north side of the lake, one can find the entrance to an old railroad tunnel as well as "Devils Punch Bowl", a popular swimming and diving area.\n\nThe lake was formed when glaciers carved out deep valleys during the last Ice Age. Initially, the Lake Crescent valley drained into the Indian Creek valley and then into Elwha River. Anadromous fish such as steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout migrated into the valley from lower waters.\n\nApproximately 8,000 years ago, a great landslide from one of the Olympic Mountains dammed Indian Creek and the deep valley filled with water. Many geologists believe that Lake Crescent and nearby Lake Sutherland formed at the same time, but became separated by the landslide.[1] The results of the landslide are easily visible from the summit of Pyramid Peak. Eventually, the water found an alternative route out of the valley, spilling into the Lyre River, over the Lyre River Falls, and out to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.\n\nHistory\n\nIn the 19th century the lake was known variously as Lake Everett, Big Lake, and Lake Crescent. In 1890, while the Port Crescent Improvement Company was promoting its townsite near the lake, M.J. Carrigan started the Port Crescent Leader to help boost the town. He wrote of the beautiful lake, which he called Lake Crescent, and the name soon became well established.	The anadromous fish populations in the lake became landlocked, because those fish could not ascend Lyre River Falls, making a barrier in that direction. Over time, two unique subspecies of fish evolved in the lake: the endemic Beardslee trout, a relative of rainbow trout, spawns in the Lyre River above the falls, while the Crescenti Cutthroat Trout spawns in Barnes Creek.\n[edit] Depth\n\nIn the early 1960s, the U.S. Navy did a survey of the lake using a Furuno depth sounder. They were not able to verify the maximum depth on their equipment. During a 1970 depth survey conducted by the students of the fisheries program at Peninsula College in Port Angeles, Washington, students used instruments that could not record measurements beyond a depth of 624 feet, which thus became the "official" depth of the lake as recorded by the National Park Service. However, when power cable was being laid in the lake, instruments showed depths in excess of 1000 feet, the maximum range of the equipment used. The actual maximum depth of Lake Crescent remains unknown.			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Crescent
310	1360	1		Quilcene is about 40-50min south of Port Townsend and 1 hour from the ferry landing (Bainbridge).   The ranger station is just south of the town limits and you get can area maps there.   While the lands around Quilcene are private, the unimproved county-type roads between it and up to Crocker Lake all lead off up into the foot hills where there is very good mushroom hunting, both edible (chanterelle and oysters that I know of) and just interesting stuff to collect.	This side of the Olympic Peninusula gets (much) less rainfall that it's more famous Western side but if you are just in the area for the day (e.g. from Seattle) this is more readily accessible.		Mostly private lands until you drive 5-10 miles into the National Forest area, but may open areas of forest in between.

313	191	4	Wikipedia	Seattle (pronounced /siːˈætəl/ ( listen) see-AT-əl) is the northernmost major city in the contiguous United States, and the largest city in the Pacific Northwest and in the state of Washington. A seaport situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound (an arm of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canada – United States border, it is named after Chief Sealth "Seattle", of the Duwamish and Suquamish native tribes. Seattle is the center of the Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue metropolitan statistical area, the 15th largest in the United States, and the largest in the northwestern United States.[8] Seattle is the county seat of King County and is the major economic, cultural and educational center in the region. As of April 2009[update], the city's population was approximately 617,000 within a metropolitan area of some 3.4 million inhabitants. The Port of Seattle and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport are major gateways to Asia, Alaska, and the rest of the world.\n\nSeattle is the western terminus of I-90 and resides on the I-5 corridor, about 170 miles (270 km) north of Portland, Oregon/Vancouver, Washington and 140 miles (230 km) south of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. The city of Victoria, British Columbia's capital, is about 110 miles (180 km) to the northwest (about 90 miles (140 km) by passenger ferry) while the eastern Washington hub city of Spokane lies 280 miles (450 km) to the east.\n\nThe Seattle area has been inhabited for at least 4,000 years,[9] but white settlement began only in the mid-19th century. The first permanent European-descended settlers, Arthur A. Denny and those subsequently known as the Denny Party, arrived November 13, 1851. Early settlements in the area were called "New York-Alki" ("Alki" meaning "by and by" in Chinook Jargon) and "Duwamps". In 1853, Doc Maynard suggested that the main settlement be renamed "Seattle", an anglicized rendition of the name of Sealth, the chief of the two local tribes. From 1869 until 1982, Seattle was known as the "Queen City".[10] Seattle's current official nickname is the "Emerald City", the result of a contest held in 1981;[11][12] the reference is to the lush evergreen forests of the area. Seattle is also referred to informally as the "Gateway to Alaska", "Rain City",[13] and "Jet City", the last from the local influence of Boeing. Seattle residents are known as Seattleites.\n\nSeattle is the birthplace of rock legend Jimi Hendrix and the rock music style known as "grunge,"[14] which was made famous by local groups Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam.\n\nSeattle has a reputation for heavy coffee consumption;[15] coffee companies founded or based in Seattle include Starbucks,[16] Seattle's Best Coffee,[17] and Tully's.[18] There are also many successful independent artisanal espresso roasters and cafes.[15]\n\nResearchers at Central Connecticut State University consistently rank Seattle and Minneapolis as the two most literate cities among America's largest cities[19][20] Additionally, survey data from the United States Census Bureau indicate that Seattle has a higher percentage of college graduates than any other major American city, with approximately 53.8% of residents aged 25 and older holding a bachelor degree or higher.[21]\n\nIn terms of per capita income, a study by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis ranked the Seattle metropolitan area 17th out of 363 metropolitan areas in 2006.[22] Seattle has particularly strong information technology, aviation, architecture and recreational industries. It is particularly known as a hotbed of "green" technologies[23], stemming in part from the strong and relatively non-controversial stances its public leaders have taken on policies regarding urban design, building standards, clean energy and climate change (Seattle in February 2010 committed itself to becoming North America's first "climate neutral" city, with a goal of reaching zero net per capita greenhouse gas emissions by 2030).[24]\n\nSeattle is ranked as one of the most car-congested cities in the United States, and efforts to promote compact development and transportation choices are perennial policy issues.[25] The railways and streetcars that once dominated its transportation system were largely replaced with an extensive network of bus routes for those living near the city center, and the city's outward growth caused automobiles to become the main mode of transportation for much of the population in the middle to late twentieth century. However, efforts to reverse this trend at the municipal and state levels have resulted in new commuter rail service that connects Seattle to Everett and Tacoma, a regional Link Light Rail system that extends south from the city core,[26] and an inner-city South Lake Union Streetcar network in the South Lake Union area.[27]\n\nArchaeological excavations confirm that the Seattle area has been inhabited by humans for at least 4,000 years.[9] By the time the first European settlers arrived in the area, the people (now called the Duwamish Tribe) occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas around Elliott Bay.[28]\n\nIn 1851, a large party led by Luther Collins made a location on land at the mouth of the Duwamish River; they formally claimed it on September 14, 1851.[29] Thirteen days later, members of the Collins Party on the way to their claim passed three scouts of the Denny Party, the group who would eventually found Seattle.[30] Members of the Denny Party claimed land on Alki Point on September 28, 1851.[31] The rest of the Denny Party set sail from Portland, Oregon and landed on Alki point during a rainstorm on November 13, 1851.[31]\n\nAfter a difficult winter, most of the Denny Party relocated across Elliott Bay and founded the village of "Dewamps" or "Duwamps" on the site of present day Pioneer Square.[31] Charles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and established a village they initially called "New York", but renamed "New York Alki" in April 1853, from a Chinook word meaning, roughly, by and by or someday.[32] New York Alki and Duwamps competed for dominance for the next few years, but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers.[33]\n\nDavid Swinson ("Doc") Maynard, one of Duwamps's founders, was the primary advocate to rename the village "Seattle" after Chief Sealth of the Duwamish and Suquamish tribes.[34] The term, "Seattle", appears on official Washington Territory papers dated May 23, 1853, when the first plats for the village were filed. In 1855, nominal land settlements were established. On January 14, 1865, the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a board of trustees managing the city. Two years later, after a petition was filed by most of the leading citizens, the Legislature disincorporated the town. The town remained a precinct of King County until late 1869 when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated with a Mayor-council government.[31][35]\n[edit] Timber town\n\nSeattle has a history of boom and bust cycles, as is common to cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources. Seattle has risen several times economically, then gone into precipitous decline, but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure.[36]\nThe Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition had just over 3.7 million visitors during its 138-day run[37]\n\nThe first such boom, covering the early years of the city, was fueled by the lumber industry. (During this period the road now known as Yesler Way was nicknamed "Skid Road",[38] after the timber skidding down the hill to Henry Yesler's sawmill. This is considered a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as Skid Row.)[36] Like much of the American West, Seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management, as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the anti-Chinese riots of 1885–1886.[39] This violence was caused by unemployed whites who determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle (anti-Chinese riots also occurred in Tacoma). Martial law was declared, and federal troops were brought in to put down the disorder. Nevertheless, the economic success in the Seattle area was so great that when the Great Seattle fire of 1889 destroyed the central business district, a far grander city center rapidly emerged in its place.[40] Finance company Washington Mutual, for example, was founded in the immediate wake of the fire.[41] This boom was followed by the construction of a park system, designed by the Olmsted brothers' landscape architecture firm.[36] However, the Panic of 1893 hit Seattle hard.[42]\n[edit] Gold Rush, World War I, and the Great Depression\n\nThe second and most dramatic boom and bust resulted from the Klondike Gold Rush, which ended the depression that had begun with the Panic of 1893; in a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the S.S. Portland docked with its famed "ton of gold", and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in Alaska and the Yukon. Those working men only found lasting wealth in a few cases, however; it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like Everett, Tacoma, Port Townsend, Bremerton, and Olympia, all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors for exchange, rather than mother-lodes for extraction, of precious metals.[43] The boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century and funded many new Seattle companies and products. In 1907, 19-year-old James E. Casey borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the American Messenger Company (later UPS). Other Seattle companies founded during this period include Nordstrom and Eddie Bauer.[41] The Gold Rush era culminated in the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909, which is largely responsible for the layout of today's University of Washington campus.[44]\nDowntown Seattle and a ferry at the Central Waterfront.\n\nA shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town; the subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the first general strike in the country[45] A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles.[46]\n\nSeattle was also the home base of impresario Alexander Pantages who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival John Considine, Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. The several theaters Scottish-born, Seattle-based architect B. Marcus Priteca built for Pantages in Seattle have all been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many of their theaters survive in other cities of the USA, often retaining the Pantages name.\n[edit] Post-war years: aircraft and software\n\nThe local economy dipped after World War II, which had seen the dispersion of the numerous Japanese-American businessmen, a consequence of Japanese American internment. The local economy rose again with manufacturing company Boeing's growing dominance in the airliner market.[47] Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair.[48] The local economy went into another major downturn in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Many left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading "Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights."[49]\nWestlake Center, a Downtown mall and southern terminus of the Seattle Center Monorail. This is the northwest corner of 5th and Pine.\n\nStill, Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities. Boeing finally chose to move its corporate headquarters to Chicago.[50] The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787); the company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington.\n\nAs prosperity began to return in the 1980s, the city was stunned by the Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when thirteen people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the International District, Seattle's Chinatown.[51] Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico to nearby Bellevue, Washington,[52] Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, RealNetworks, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT&T Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile USA), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new citizens with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000,[53] and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country.[54] Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remain relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.[55][56]\n\nSeattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies, but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games[57] and the APEC leaders conference in 1993, as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge, a sound that had developed in Seattle's independent music scene.[58] Another bid for worldwide attention—hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999—garnered visibility, but not in the manner its sponsors desired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself.[59] The city was further shaken by the Mardi Gras Riots in 2001, and was literally shaken the following day by the Nisqually Earthquake.[60]\n\nThe UK consulting firm Mercer, in a 2009 assessment "conducted to help governments and major companies place employees on international assignments", ranked Seattle 50th worldwide in quality of living; the survey factored in political stability, personal freedom, sanitation, crime, housing, the natural environment, recreation, banking facilities, availability of consumer goods, education, and public services including transportation.[61]\n[edit] Geography\nPanoramic view of Seattle, as seen from the Space Needle.\n[edit] Topography\nSee also: List of Seattle parks, Bodies of water of Seattle, and Regrading in Seattle\nDowntown Seattle is bounded by Elliott Bay (lower left), lower Broadway (from upper left to lower right), Yesler Way (lower right), and Denny Way (obscured by clouds).\n\nSeattle is located between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) to the west, and Lake Washington to the east. The city's chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is an inlet of Puget Sound. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Mountains on the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the eastside suburbs, are Lake Sammamish and the Cascade Range. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound through the Lake Washington Ship canal (a series of two man-made canals), Lake Union, and the Hiram C. Chittenden Locks at Salmon Bay, ending in Shilshole Bay.\n\nThe sea, rivers, forests, lakes, and fields surrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world's few sedentary hunter-gatherer societies. The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing, bicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.[62] [63]\n\nThe city itself is hilly, though not uniformly so.[64] Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills[65]; the lists vary, but typically include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford and Mount Baker neighborhoods are technically located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington.[66] The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center.[67] The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) at the mouth of the city's industrial Duwamish Waterway. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant, Maple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge, Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake.\n\nNorth of the city center, Lake Washington Ship Canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington. It incorporates four natural bodies of water: Lake Union, Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, and Union Bay.\n\nDue to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone. On February 28, 2001, the magnitude 6.8 Nisqually earthquake did significant architectural damage, especially in the Pioneer Square area (built on reclaimed land, as are the Industrial District and part of the city center), but caused no fatalities.[68] Other strong quakes occurred on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9 magnitude), December 14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4),[68] April 13, 1949 (7.1),[69] and April 29, 1965 (6.5).[70] The 1949 quake caused eight known deaths, all in Seattle;[69] the 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly, and one more by heart failure.[70] Although the Seattle Fault passes just south of the city center, neither it[71] nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city's founding. The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.[72]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 142.5 square miles (369 km2),[73] 83.9 square miles (217 km2) of which is land and 58.7 square miles (152 km2) water (41.16 percent of the total area).\n[edit] Surrounding municipalities\n\tBainbridge Island \tShoreline \tLake Forest Park \t\nPuget Sound \t\tMercer Island\n   Seattle    \nVashon Island \tTukwila \tRenton\n[edit] Climate\nDowntown Seattle averages 58 clear (sunny) days a year, with most of those days occurring between May and September[74]\n\nSeattle's temperate, rainy climate is usually described as temperate Oceanic or Marine west coast, with mild, wet winters and mild, relatively dry summers. Like much of the Pacific Northwest, according to the Köppen climate classification it falls within a cool, dry-summer subtropical zone (Csb), with cool-summer Mediterranean characteristics such as its usually dry summers.[75] Other climate classification systems, such as Trewartha, place it firmly in the Oceanic zone (Do).[76]\n\nTemperature extremes are moderated by adjacent Puget Sound, the greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. The region is partially protected from Pacific storms by the Olympic Mountains and from Arctic air by the Cascade Range. Despite being on the margin of the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains, the city has a reputation for frequent rain.[77] This reputation derives from this frequency of precipitation (150 days of precipitation > 0.01 in/0.3 mm) as well as the fact that it is cloudy an average of 201 days and 93 partly cloudy days per year.[74] At 37.1 inches (942 mm)[78], the city receives less precipitation than New York, Atlanta, Houston, and most cities of the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Seattle was also not listed in a study that revealed the 10 rainiest cities in the continental United States.[79] Most of the precipitation falls as drizzle or light rain. Thunderstorms occur only occasionally. Seattle reports thunder on just seven days per year (according to 'Cities Ranked and Rated' - Bert Sperling and Peter Sander.2007). For comparison Fort Myers, Florida reports thunder on 93 days per year. Kansas City reports 52 'thunder days' and New York City reports 25. There are occasional downpours. One of these downpours occurred in December 2007 when widespread rainfall hit the greater Puget Sound area. It became the second wettest event in Seattle history when a little over 5 inches of rain fell on Seattle in a 24 hour period. The rain also caused five deaths and widespread flooding and damage.[80] Spring, late fall, and winter are filled with days when it does not rain but looks as if it might because of cloudy, overcast skies. Winters are cool and wet with average lows in the mid to upper 30s °F (2-4 °C) on winter nights. Colder weather can occur, but seldom lasts more than a few days. Summers are dry and warm, with average daytime highs around near 75 °F (24 °C). Hotter weather usually occurs only during a few summer days. Seattle's hottest official recorded temperature was 103 °F (39 °C) on July 29, 2009;[81] the coldest recorded temperature was 0 °F (−18 °C) on January 31, 1950.[78]\nBetween October and May, Seattle is mostly or partly cloudy six out of every seven days[74]\n\nEighty miles (130 km) to the west, the Hoh Rain Forest in Olympic National Park on the western flank of the Olympic Mountains receives an annual average rainfall of 142 inches (3,610 mm), and the state capital, Olympia—south of the rain shadow—receives an annual average rainfall of 52 inches (1,320 mm). Snowfall is very infrequent, especially at lower elevations and near the coast, and is usually light and fleeting, lasting only a few days. Heavier snowfall happens infrequently; a recent example happened from December 12–25, 2008, when over one foot of snow fell and stuck on much of the city's roads, causing widespread difficulties in a city so unaccustomed to heavy snow. Average annual snowfall, as measured at Sea-Tac Airport, is 13 inches (33 cm).[82] Seattle's daily record snowfall was 20 inches (51 cm) on January 13, 1950.[83] A sunnier and drier climate typically dominates from mid-July to mid-September. An average of 0.8 inches (20 mm) of rain falls in July and 1.0 inch (25 mm) in August. Although the summer climate is considerably drier and less humid than in areas with humid continental climates, a slight dampness can be occasionally felt, usually when temperatures reach above 80 °F (26.7 °C). This dampness is typically more noticeable during the evening when the temperatures have dropped. Because of this, Seattle experiences occasional summer thunderstorms.[84]\n\nThe Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an important feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited by the Cascade Mountains to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection.[85] Thunderstorms caused by this activity can occur north and south of town, but Seattle itself rarely receives worse weather than occasional thunder and ice-pellet showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to 69 mph (111 km/h).\n\nAnother exception to Seattle's dampness may occur in El Niño years, when the marine weather systems track as far south as California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound area.[86] Since the region's water comes from mountain snowpacks during the drier summer months, El Niño winters can not only produce substandard skiing but can result in water rationing and a shortage of hydroelectric power the following summer.[87]\n\nThe Space Needle, dating from the Century 21 Exposition (1962), is Seattle's most recognizable landmark, having been featured in the logo of the television show Frasier and the backgrounds of the television series Dark Angel, Grey's Anatomy and iCarly, and films such as It Happened at the World's Fair, Sleepless in Seattle, and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. The fairgrounds surrounding the Needle have been converted into Seattle Center, which remains the site of many local civic and cultural events, such as Bumbershoot, Folklife, and the Bite of Seattle. Seattle Center plays multiple roles in the city, ranging from a public fair ground to a civic center, though recent economic losses have called its viability and future into question.[102] The Seattle Center Monorail was also constructed for Century 21 and still runs from Seattle Center to Westlake Center, a downtown shopping mall, a little over a mile to the southeast.\nPike Place Market\n\nThe Smith Tower was the tallest building on the West Coast from its completion in 1914 until the Space Needle overtook it in 1962.[103] The late 1980s saw the construction of Seattle's two tallest skyscrapers: the 76 story Columbia Center (completed 1985) is the tallest building in the Pacific Northwest[104] and the fourth tallest building west of the Mississippi River;[105] the Washington Mutual Tower (completed 1988) is Seattle's second tallest building.[106][107] Other notable Seattle landmarks include Pike Place Market, the Fremont Troll, the Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame (at Seattle Center), and the Seattle Central Library.\n\nStarbucks has been at Pike Place Market since the coffee company was founded there in 1971. The first store is still operating a block south of its original location.[108]\n\nThe National Register of Historic Places has over 150 Seattle listings.[109] The city also designates its own landmarks.[110]\n[edit] Culture\n[edit] Performing arts\nMain article: Arts in Seattle\n\nSeattle has been a regional center for the performing arts for many years. The century-old Seattle Symphony Orchestra is among the world's most recorded[111] and performs primarily at Benaroya Hall.[112] The Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet, which perform at McCaw Hall (opened 2003 on the site of the former Seattle Opera House at Seattle Center), are comparably distinguished,[113][114] with the Opera being particularly known for its performances of the works of Richard Wagner[115][116] and the PNB School (founded in 1974) ranking as one of the top three ballet training institutions in the United States.[113] The Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestras (SYSO) is the largest symphonic youth organization in the United States.[117] The city also boasts lauded summer and winter chamber music festivals organized by the Seattle Chamber Music Society.[118]\n\nThe 5th Avenue Theatre, built in 1926, stages Broadway-style musical shows[119] featuring both local talent and international stars.[120] Seattle has "around 100" theatrical production companies[121][122] and over two dozen live theatre venues, many of them associated with fringe theatre;[123] Seattle is probably second only to New York for number of equity theaters[124] (28 Seattle theater companies have some sort of Actors' Equity contract).[121] In addition, the 900-seat Romanesque Revival Town Hall on First Hill hosts numerous cultural events, especially lectures and recitals.[125]\nThe Moore Theatre has been a performing arts venue in Downtown Seattle since its construction in 1907.\n\nSeattle is considered the home of grunge music[14] because it was home to artists such as Soundgarden, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Mudhoney, all of whom reached vast audiences in the early 1990s.[126] The city is also home to such varied musicians as avant-garde jazz musicians Bill Frisell and Wayne Horvitz, rapper Sir Mix-a-Lot, smooth jazz saxophonist Kenny G, Heart, heavy metal bands Queensrÿche, Nevermore and Sunn O))), as well as such poppier rock bands as Harvey Danger, Goodness, and The Presidents of the United States of America. Such musicians as Jimi Hendrix, Duff McKagan, Nikki Sixx, and Quincy Jones spent their formative years in Seattle.\n\nSince the grunge era, the area has hosted a diverse and influential alternative music scene. The Seattle record label Sub Pop—the first to sign Nirvana and Soundgarden—has signed such non-grunge bands as Band of Horses, Modest Mouse, Murder City Devils, Sunny Day Real Estate, Death Cab for Cutie, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, and Fleet Foxes.[126]\n\nEarlier Seattle-based popular music acts include the collegiate folk group The Brothers Four; The Wailers, a 1960s garage band; The Ventures, an instrumental rock band; pop Young Fresh Fellows and The Posies; pop-punk The Fastbacks; the well-traveled avant-rock of Sun City Girls; and the outright punk of The Fartz (later 10 Minute Warning), The Gits, and 7 Year Bitch.[127]\n\nSeattle annually sends a team of spoken word slammers to the National Poetry Slam and considers itself home to such performance poets as Buddy Wakefield, two-time Individual World Poetry Slam Champ;[128] Anis Mojgani, two-time National Poetry Slam Champ;[129] and Danny Sherrard, 2007 National Poetry Slam Champ and 2008 Individual World Poetry Slam Champ.[130] Seattle also hosted the 2001 national Poetry Slam Tournament. The Seattle Poetry Festival is a biennial poetry festival that (launched first as the Poetry Circus in 1997) has featured local, regional, national, and international names in poetry.[131]\n\nThe city also has movie houses showing both Hollywood productions and works by independent filmmakers.[132] Among these, the Seattle Cinerama stands out as one of only three movie theaters in the world still capable of showing three-panel Cinerama films.[133][134]\n\nAdditionally, the city is also home to the Seattle Polish Film Festival, ("SPFF") an annual film festival showcasing current and past films of Polish cinema.[135][136] The festival is produced by the Seattle-Gdynia Sister City Association and awards the Seattle Spirit of Polish Cinema awards as well as the Viewers Choice of Best Film.\n\nThe city is the fictional home to the Nickelodeon cable television show, iCarly.\n[edit] Media\nMain article: Media in Seattle\n\nAs of 2010, Seattle has one major daily newspaper, The Seattle Times. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, known as the P-I, published a daily newspaper from 1863 to March 17, 2009. There is also the Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce,[137] and the University of Washington publishes The Daily, a student-run publication, when school is in session. The most prominent weeklies are the Seattle Weekly and The Stranger; both consider themselves "alternative" papers.[138] Real Change is a weekly street newspaper that is sold mainly by homeless persons as an alternative to panhandling. There are also several ethnic newspapers, including the Northwest Asian Weekly, and numerous neighborhood newspapers, including the North Seattle Journal.\n\nSeattle is also well served by television and radio, with all major U.S. networks represented, along with at least five other English-language stations and two Spanish-language stations.[139] Seattle cable viewers also receive CBUT 2 (CBC) from Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nNon-commercial radio stations include NPR affiliates KUOW-FM 94.9 and KPLU-FM 88.5 (Tacoma). Other stations include KEXP-FM 90.3 (affiliated with EMP), KBCS-FM 91.3 (affiliated with Bellevue College), and KNHC-FM 89.5, which broadcasts an electronic music format and is owned by the public school system and operated by students of Nathan Hale High School. Many Seattle radio stations are also available through Internet radio, with KEXP in particular being a pioneer of Internet radio.[140] Seattle also has numerous commercial radio stations, including KING-FM, one of the last commercial classical music stations in the United States.[139]\n\nSeattle-based online magazines Worldchanging and Grist.org were two of the "Top Green Websites" in 2007 according to Time.[141]\n\nSeattle also has many online newspapers. The two largest are The Seattle Times and Seattle Post-Intelligencer (the latter online only).\n[edit] Tourism\nSee also: Museums and galleries of Seattle\n210 cruise ship visits brought 886,039 passengers to Seattle in 2008.[142]\n\nAmong Seattle's prominent annual fairs and festivals are the 24-day Seattle International Film Festival,[143] Northwest Folklife over the Memorial Day weekend, numerous Seafair events throughout July and August (ranging from a Bon Odori celebration to the Seafair Cup hydroplane races), the Bite of Seattle, one of the largest Gay Pride festivals in the United States, and the art and music festival Bumbershoot, which programs music as well as other art and entertainment over the Labor Day weekend. All are typically attended by 100,000 people annually, as are the Seattle Hempfest and two separate Independence Day celebrations.[144][145][146] In the past, the Gay Pride parade and festival have been centered on Capitol Hill, but since 2006, festivities have been held city-wide, and the parade has followed a route in Downtown from the retail core to Seattle Center.[147]\n\nOther significant events include numerous Native American pow-wows, a Greek Festival hosted by St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church in Montlake, and numerous ethnic festivals (many associated with Festál at Seattle Center).[148]\nThe Seattle skyline viewed from Gas Works Park.\n\nThere are other annual events, ranging from the Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair & Book Arts Show;[149] an anime convention, Sakura-Con;[150] Penny Arcade Expo, a gaming convention;[151] specialized film festivals, such as the Maelstrom International Fantastic Film Festival, the Seattle Gay and Lesbian Film Festival;[152] and a two-day, 9,000-rider Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic.[153]\n\nThe Henry Art Gallery opened in 1927, the first public art museum in Washington.[154] The Seattle Art Museum (SAM) opened in 1933; SAM opened a museum downtown in 1991 (expanded and reopened 2007); since 1991, the 1933 building has been SAM's Seattle Asian Art Museum (SAAM).[155] SAM also operates the Olympic Sculpture Park (opened 2007) on the waterfront north of the downtown piers. The Frye Art Museum is a free museum on First Hill.\n\nRegional history collections are at the Loghouse Museum in Alki, Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park, the Museum of History and Industry and the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. Industry collections are at the Center for Wooden Boats and the adjacent Northwest Seaport, the Seattle Metropolitan Police Museum, and the Museum of Flight. Regional ethnic collections include the Nordic Heritage Museum, the Wing Luke Asian Museum and the Northwest African American Museum. Seattle has artist-run galleries,[156] including 10-year veteran Soil Art Gallery,[157] and the newer Crawl Space Gallery.[158]\n\nWoodland Park Zoo opened as a private menagerie in 1889, but was sold to the city in 1899.[159] The Seattle Aquarium has been open on the downtown waterfront since 1977 (undergoing a renovation 2006).[160] The Seattle Underground Tour is an exhibit of places that existed before the Great Fire.[161] There are also many community centers for recreation, including Rainier Beach, Van Asselt, Rainier, and Jefferson south of the Ship Canal and Green Lake, Laurelhurst, Loyal Heights north of the Canal, and Meadowbrook.[162]\n\nSince the middle 1990s, Seattle has experienced significant growth in the cruise industry, especially as a departure point for Alaska cruises. In 2008, a record total of 886,039 cruise passengers passed through the city, surpassing the number for Vancouver, BC, the other major departure point for Alaska cruises.[163]	Seattle's mild, temperate marine climate allows year-round outdoor recreation, including walking, cycling, hiking, skiing, snowboarding, kayaking, rock climbing, motor boating, sailing, team sports, and swimming.[170] In town, many people walk around Green Lake, through the forests and along the bluffs and beaches of 535-acre (2.2 km2) Discovery Park (the largest park in the city) in Magnolia, along the shores of Myrtle Edwards Park on the Downtown waterfront, along the shoreline of Lake Washington at Seward Park, or along Alki Beach in West Seattle. Also popular are hikes and skiing in the nearby Cascade or Olympic Mountains and kayaking and sailing in the waters of Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the Strait of Georgia. In 2005, Men's Fitness magazine named Seattle the fittest city in the United States.			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_from_Seattle

315	23635	4	Wikipedia	Everett is the county seat of and the largest city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States.[4] Named for Everett Colby, son of founder Charles L. Colby, it lies 25 miles (40 km) north of Seattle. The city had a total population of 91,488 at the 2000 census, making it the 6th largest in the state and fourth-largest in the Puget Sound area. Since the census, the city has continued to grow, reaching an estimated population of 99,384 in 2009.[5] It received an All-America City Award in 2002.[6]\n\nEverett is home to the largest public marina on the west coast of the United States[7] and is the western terminus of the western segment of U.S. Route 2. It is also home to Boeing's assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and the new 787 in the largest building in the world by volume at 116.5 million cubic feet (13.3 million cubic m).\n\nIn 1984, Everett was selected as the site of a U.S. Navy Homeport, Naval Station Everett. The Naval Station formally opened in 1992 and on January 8, 1997 welcomed the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. Everett is also home to the Port of Everett, an international shipping port, that brings trade, commerce, jobs and recreational opportunities to the city.\n\nThe land on which Everett was founded was surrendered to the United States by its original inhabitants under the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott.[8] Permanent settlement in the area by European descendants started in 1861 when Dennis Brigham built a cabin on a 160-acre (0.6 km2) claim on the shore of Port Gardner Bay. Over the next several years, a handful of settlers moved to the area but it wasn't until 1890 that plans for platting a town were conceived.\n\nOn July 17, 1890, The steamship Queen of the Pacific left Tacoma for an Alaskan cruise with Henry Hewitt, Jr. and Charles L. Colby aboard. During this "Fateful voyage" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The Rucker Brothers filed their plat at Port Gardner, a 50-acre (200,000 m2) townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat is later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group.\n\nOn September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what is to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that will become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and Colgate Hoyt. In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, fifteen year old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator Edward Everett.\n\nOn November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred 434.15 acres (1.7569 km2) of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, "The Remarkable Document" is drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development.\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the Great Northern Railway came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that James J. Hill would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of Puget Sound to Seattle. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of Monte Cristo depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the Yukon gold rush.\n\nSeveral survivors of the Bellingham riots settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the Everett Massacre of 1916 which was an armed confrontation between a mob led by local Sheriff Donald McRae and IWW members. The IWW members were on the steamer Verona and sought to land, but Sheriff McRae denied them his permission. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW's were killed and two in the Sheriff's mob were killed, though they might have been accidentally shot by others in their allegedly drunken group.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the BNSF Railway tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge Hiram Bond, President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, John D. Rockefeller, railroad executive T.F. Oakes, shipbuilder Alexander McDougall, and McDougall's associate Charles W. Wetmore.\n[edit] Geography\n[edit] Topography\n\nEverett is located at 47°" West (47.963434, -122.200527).[9] The city is one of the core cities comprising the Seattle-Tacoma-Olympia CMSA.\n\nThe core of Everett sits on the Port Gardner Peninsula, formed by Port Gardner Bay on the west and the Snohomish River to the north and east. Newer portions of the city generally extend southward from this point for a distance of approximately 8 miles (13 km).\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau the city has a total area of 47.7 square miles (123.4 km²), of which, 32.5 square miles (84.2 km²) of it is land and 39.2 km² (15.1 mi;oi²) of it is water. The total area is 31.79% water.\n\nHistoric district\nHenry M.

The district contains many old stately homes including the home of the former U.S. Senator Henry M. Jackson on Grand Avenue.\n[edit] Waterfront\nView from Everett Yacht Club on Port Gardner Wharf\n\nSituated at the mouth of the Snohomish River on Possession Sound, the Everett waterfront is home to Naval Station Everett, a sprawling Kimberly-Clark paper mill and the Port of Everett (est. 1918). The Port of Everett includes both a deep-water commercial seaport and a marina with over 2000 slips, which it claims to be the largest on the west coast of the United States.[10] Ambitious redevelopment began in 2006 to convert the north end of the waterfront into a community of maritime business, retail shops and condominiums, beginning with the Port of Everett's Port Gardner Wharf. In 2006, the seaport received 119 ships and 59 barges, totaling some 192,000 short tons of cargo.[11]\n\nThe waterfront is also home to the Everett Yacht Club, which was founded in 1907, although it existed in some form as early as 1895.[12] During summer months, the marina is home to the Everett Farmer's Market (Sundays) and the Waterfront Concert Series (Thursday nights), part of a city-wide free concert series which in 2006 attracted over 26,000 visitors.[13] Each September, Tenth Street Park on the waterfront is home to the annual Everett Coho Derby,[14] while each August the marina promenade is gowned in local art during the Fresh Paint Festival of Artists.[15]\n[edit] Parks and gardens\nGrand Ave. Park\n\nEverett is home to 40 parks. The biggest parks are Walter E. Hall Park at 137 acres (554,419.3 m2), Forest Park at 111 acres (449,201.1 m2), Langus Riverfront Park at 96 acres (390,000 m2), Kasch Park at 60 acres (240,000 m2), Howarth Park at 28 acres (110,000 m2), and Thornton A. Sullivan Park at 27 acres (110,000 m2).[16] Walter E. Hall Park near the Boeing plant sports a golf course and a skate park, Forest Park a swimming pool, hockey, horseshoes, miles of trails and an animal farm, Langus Park a boat launch, Kasch Park four softball fields, Howarth Park a sandy beach on Puget Sound, and Thornton A. Sullivan Park hosts a sandy swimming beach on Silver Lake as well as public docks for fishing.\n[edit] Forest park\n\nForest Park is the oldest public park in Everett. Its address is 802 E. Mukilteo Boulevard. The park is 111 acres (449,201.1 m2) and is home to miles of trails, a playground, and a pool. The pool is the crowning jewel of the park, complete with lifeguards. Hundreds of children take swimming lessons at the pool every year, making the pool an extremely valuable part of the parks system.\n[edit] Jetty Island\n\nAlong the waterfront lies the Port of Everett owned Jetty Island, a narrow, 2-mile (3.2 km) long man-made island, featuring large sandy beaches and relatively warm water. Jetty Island is the result of a failed attempt in the early 1900s by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a freshwater harbor west of downtown Everett. The island is now a day-use park with no running water, electricity, or overnight facilities. The City of Everett Parks and Recreation Department celebrates Jetty Island Days during the summer, and provides free ferry service to the island from the 10th Street Boat Launch from June through the Labor Day holiday weekend. The wide flat beaches and strong winds make the island a popular kite-surfing destination as well as a popular spot for avid skimboarders.\n[edit] Nishiyama Garden\n\nNishiyama Garden is a traditional Japanese garden located at the Nippon Business Institute at Everett Community College. It features Sukiya style wooden gates, gravel paths, stones, trees, a small stream and a portion of a famous Kintai Bridge from Iwakuni, Japan, one of Everett's sister cities.[17]\n[edit] Evergreen Arboretum and Gardens\n\nEvergreen Arboretum and Gardens (2.4 acres) is an arboretum and park located at the south end of Legion Park, at the intersection of Alverson and Marine View Drive.[18] Gardens include sculpture and vistas of Puget Sound, as well as:\n\n    * Conifer garden - includes Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, Chamaecyparis nootkatensis, Pfitzeriana Aurea, Picea glauca, and Strobus ‘Nana’.\n    * Dahlia garden - a variety of dahlias.\n    * Japanese Maple grove - 17 varieties of maples, with ferns and hydrangeas.\n    * Perennial border - includes artichoke (Cynara scolymus), Japanese forest grass (Hakonechloa macra), giant hyssop (Hyssopus officinalis), dwarf waterlily (Nymphaea), and New Zealand flax (Phormium cookianum).\n    * Small Urban Tree Walk\n    * White border - flowers and foliage in white, silver, and blue.\n    * Woodland garden - grotto with Knadhill and Exbury azaleas, lace-cap hydrangeas (Hydrangea macrophylla), and Pieris japonica.\n\n[edit] Neighborhoods\n\nThe city of Everett maintains an Office of Neighborhoods which facilitate communication between the city and the 19 established neighborhood associations, with one proposed neighborhood/mixed-use development.

319	1379	1		New York is the most populous city in the United States, and the center of the New York metropolitan area, which is one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the world. A leading global city, New York exerts a powerful influence over global commerce, finance, media, culture, art, fashion, research, education, and entertainment. As host of the United Nations Headquarters, it is also an important center for international affairs. The city is often referred to as New York City or the City of New York to distinguish it from the state of New York, of which it is a part.\n\nLocated on a large natural harbor on the Atlantic coast of the Northeastern United States, the city consists of five boroughs: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. The city's 2009 estimated population approached 8.4 million,[2] and with a land area of 305 square miles (790 km2),[3][4][5] New York City is the most densely populated major city in the United States.[6] The New York metropolitan area's population is also the nation's largest, estimated at 19.1 million people over 6,720 square miles (17,400 km2). Furthermore, the Combined Statistical Area containing the greater New York metropolitan area contained 22.2 million people as of 2009 Census estimates, also the largest in the United States.\n\nNew York was founded as a commercial trading post by the Dutch in 1624. The settlement was called New Amsterdam until 1664 when the colony came under English control.[7] New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790.[8] It has been the country's largest city since 1790.[9] As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York City, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[10]\n\nMany districts and landmarks in the city have become well known to outsiders. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Times Square, iconified as "The Crossroads of the World", is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway theater district, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. Anchored by Wall Street, in Lower Manhattan, New York vies with London as the financial capital of the world[11][12][13][14][15][16][17] and is home to the New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest stock exchange by market capitalization of its listed companies. The original Manhattan Chinatown attracts throngs of tourists to its bustling sidewalks and retail establishments. World-class schools and universities such as Columbia University and New York University also reside in New York City.	New York City is located in the Northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston.[47] The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. Much of New York is built on the three islands of Manhattan, Staten Island, and Long Island, making land scarce and encouraging a high population density.\n\nThe Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary.[48] The Hudson separates the city from New Jersey. The East River – a tidal strait – flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely fresh water river in the city.[49]\n\nThe city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times. Reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s.[50] Some of the natural variations in topography have been evened out, especially in Manhattan.[51]\n\nThe city's land area is estimated at 304.8 square miles (789 km2).[4][5] Its total area is 468.9 square miles (1,214 km2). 164.1 square miles (425 km2) of this are water and 304.8 square miles (789 km2) is land. The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level, is the highest point on the Eastern Seaboard south of Maine.[52] The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.[53]\nClimate\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification New York City has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), and using the 0 °C threshold it is the northernmost major city on the continent with such categorisation.\n\nThe area averages 234 days with at least some sunshine annually, for an average of 2540 hours of bright sunshine per year .[54] Winters are cold and wet, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean. Yet, the Atlantic and the partial shielding of the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities located at similar or lesser latitudes such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. The average temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 32.1 °F (0.1 °C). However temperatures in winter could for a few days be as low as 20 °F (−7 °C) and as high as 60 °F (16 °C).[55] Spring and autumn are unpredictable, and can range from chilly to warm, although they are usually pleasantly mild with low humidity. Summers are typically hot and humid with a July average of 76.5 °F (24.7 °C). Nighttime conditions are often exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon, and temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on average of 18 days each summer and can exceed 104 °F (40 °C) every 4–6 years.[56][57]\n\nThe city receives 49.7 inches (1,260 mm) of precipitation annually, which is fairly spread throughout the year. Average winter snowfall for the past century has been 28 inches (71 cm), but this usually varies considerably from year to year, and snow cover usually remains for a few days.[58] Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area, but are not unheard of and always have the potential to strike the area.\n\nNational Park System\n\nGateway National Recreation Area; the New York State portion includes the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in Brooklyn, over 9,000 acres (36 km2) of salt marsh, islands and water that covers most of Jamaica Bay.

324	1449	1	Wikipedia	Lake City is the northeast region of Seattle, centered along Lake City Way NE (SR-522), 7–8 miles (11–13 km) northeast of downtown. A broader definition of the Lake City area includes all the land between 15th Avenue NE and Lake Washington, and between NE 85th and 98th streets to the Seattle city limits at NE 145th Street.[1] Lake City encompasses much of the Thornton Creek watershed, the focus of a long restoration campaign by citizens and Seattle Public Utilities staff to enhance the residential environment of Lake City.\n\nHistory\n\nWhat is now Lake City has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE—10,000 years ago). The hah-chu-ahbsh (Lake People), now of the Duwamish tribe, Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish,[2] lived in diffuse permanent settlements along the shore of Lake Washington, dispersing in the summer, and in the winter living in large cedar long houses, each home to a couple dozen or more members of extended family groups. The lake people lost their rights in 1854. The Lake City area was clearcut by crude wagon road or by using Lake Washington, from 1850 past the turn of the century, more rapidly with the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (c. 1886) providing easy access along what is now the Burke-Gilman Trail adjacent to the lake. Wetlands were drained. A Little Germany neighborhood of several immigrant farmers grew up in the 1870s around where Nathan Hale High School now stands.[3]\n\nThe Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway operated a passenger stop near the current location of NE 115th St called simply, "Lake". The area was dubbed Lake City by D.H. and R.H. Lee in 1906 after they purchased and platted the land. With the advent of the automobile, the area developed linearly around major roads rather than centrally around trolley stops, as in older Seattle neighborhoods. The road to Bothell and Everett was made all-weather with brick in 1918 and then the new material asphalt in 1928. The automobile relationship with Seattle would shape Lake City development and neighborhood character. Lake City would remain relatively remote and suburban from Seattle until years after WWII.\n\nTransition to a neighborhood community was marked in 1935 with the start of the Lake City Branch Library of today as a few shelves of books in part of a room in Lake City School, shared with the WPA. Sponsorship was by the Pacific Improvement Club community group. Lake City incorporated as a township in 1949 with more than 40,000 residents; rapid growth was a product of a massive influx of young suburban families after World War II. The City of Seattle annexed Lake City and other communities in 1954 when the city limits were expanded from 85th Street to 145th Street.[4] Scout Troop 240 and other volunteers moved thousands of books into a new library building in 1955.[5]\n\nLake City relies heavily on retail commerce, and business in the area has risen and fallen based on highway expansion in the Seattle area. The expansion of Aurora Avenue North to Everett, Washington cut into business in the 1920s, but Lake City revived after NE 130th Street was paved. The opening of Northgate Mall in 1950 reduced retail business in Lake City, and the area took another hit after the construction of Interstate 5 in the 1960s. Renovation of the city core along Lake City Way NE near NE 125th Street helped revive the local economy in the late 1970s.[3]\n\n				www.wikipedia.com

326	1461	1	Wikipedia	The Industrial District is the principal industrial area of Seattle, Washington. It is bounded on the west by the Duwamish Waterway and Elliott Bay, beyond which lies Delridge of West Seattle; on the east by Interstate 5, beyond which lies Beacon Hill; on the north by S King and S Dearborn Streets, beyond which lie Pioneer Square and southwest International District of Downtown; and on the south by the main lines of the BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad, or about S Lucille Street, beyond which is Georgetown. SoDo is the name of the northwest portion of the neighborhood, named for its being South of Downtown. SoDo is the location of Safeco Field, home of the Seattle Mariners, and Qwest Field, home of the Seattle Seahawks and Seattle Sounders FC. Qwest Field was also the site of the former Kingdome.\nThe old immigration building at the northern end of the neighborhood on Airport Way S.\n\nThe Industrial District may also be defined by land use, with the primarily residential and open space Delridge district extending west from W Marginal Way SW and south of SW Spokane Street, and with the heavy industrial-zoned lower Duwamish Waterway east of Marginal and north of Spokane as part of the Industrial District.[1]\n\nMost of the Industrial District is built on what was once the mudflats and lowlands of Elliott Bay and the Duwamish estuary, dredged, straightened, and filled 1902 and 1907.[2] Much of the area is also built on landfill which is prone to liquefaction. This makes buildings in this area highly prone to earthquake damage.[3]\n\nPrincipal arterials are 1st and 4th avenues S, the Alaskan Way Viaduct, East Marginal and Airport ways S (north- and southbound); and S Spokane, the Spokane Street Viaduct, West Seattle Bridge, and S Royal Brougham Way (east- and westbound). Minor arterials are 6th Avenue S, S Holgate and S Lander streets, and S Industrial Way.\n\nWhat is now Seattle has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE—10,000 years ago). For example, the villages of tohl-AHL-too ("herring house") and later hah-AH-poos ("where there are horse clams") at the then-mouth of the Duwamish River in what is now the Industrial District, had been inhabited since the 6th century CE.[5] The Dkhw’Duw’Absh and Xacuabš[6] ("People of the Inside" and "People of the Large Lake", now the Duwamish tribe) of the Lushootseed (Whulshootseed, Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish nations inhabited at least 17 villages in the mid-1850s,[7] living in some 93 permanent longhouses (khwaac'ál'al) along Elliott Bay, Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, Lake Washington, Lake Sammamish, and the Duwamish, Black, and Cedar rivers.[8]\n\nIn 1905 the Seattle Box Company relocated to the southeast corner of 4th Avenue S and S Spokane Street becoming one of the first residents of the Industrial District.[citation needed]\n\nStarbucks moved its world headquarters to the Industrial District in 1997, occupying the 1912 building constructed for Sears, Roebuck and Company (now Sears Holdings Corporation, 2005) as a catalog distribution center, another early, prominent business.[citation needed]\n\nSome current industrial business owners are concerned about the future of the Industrial District.[9] The area is seen by some city developers as an ideal zone in which to expand non-industrial businesses and residential land use south of Downtown Seattle.[10]	INDUSTRIAL!!!!

The project is operated by a Kichwa indigenous community (around 78 members belonging to 13 families).\n\nThe community’s main objective is to conserve its primary forest, both flora and fauna. Shayari is home to a major rainforest fauna rescue center that shelters tapirs, peccaries, monkeys, toucans, and parrots, among other animals. It features a breeding facility and special habitat areas for tapirs and peccaries. The projects to conserve their forest as well as the rescue center are both maintained through tourism revenues.\n\nThe activities that are offered to visitor staying at the community include walks in the forest, energy renewal (in the waterfalls, shaman), swinging on lianas, participating in the community’s daily chores at the jungle fauna rescue center – like feeding tapirs and monkeys–, and sharing the community`s life. 			Past the Río Reventador, it is 30 km to Lumbaqui (population 4000, altitude 500 m). The town provides access to Shayari (14 km off the main road, contact Lago Agrio T06-283 1930, or T09-360 6462 on site, US$32 per person per night including rustic) accommodation, meals and guided excursions.	http://www.myadventurecuador.com/turismo_kichwa_shayari.html

The city shares its borders with East Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Stanford, Portola Valley, and Menlo Park. It is named after a redwood tree called El Palo Alto. The city includes portions of Stanford University, is headquarters to a number of Silicon Valley high-technology companies, including Hewlett-Packard, VMware, Tesla Motors, IDEO, and Facebook, and has served as an incubator to several other high-technology companies, such as Google[2], Logitech[3], Intuit, Sun Microsystems[4], and PayPal. As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 58,598 residents." Source: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California," accessed 02/02/2011.	"Palo Alto has a number of significant natural habitats, including estuarine, riparian, and oak forest. Many of these habitats are visible in Foothill Park, which is owned by the city. The Charleston Slough contains a rich marsh and littoral zone, providing feeding areas for a variety of shorebirds and other estuarine wildlife.[7]\n\nPalo Alto is in the south-eastern section of the San Francisco Peninsula. It is bordered to the north by East Palo Alto, to the east by Mountain View, to the southeast and south by Los Altos and Los Altos Hills, to the southwest by Portola Valley, and to the west by Stanford and Menlo Park.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 66.4 km² (25.6 mi²). 61.3 km² (23.7 mi²) of it is land and 5.1 km² (or 7.6%) is water.\n\nThe official elevation is 56 feet (17 m) above sea level, but the city boundaries reach well into the peninsula hills.

344	723	1		Palo Alto has only one major crosstown arterial, Page Mill Road / Oregon Expressway, which connects freeways US 101 and I-280.  It extends from US 101 to Skyline Drive, California State Route 35. It is also designated as County Route G3.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n"County Route G3, more commonly known as Page Mill Road and Oregon Expressway is a short 4.5 mile (7 km) northeast-southwest arterial route that spans the lower peninsula region of the San Francisco Bay Area from I-280 to US 101. G3 runs through Palo Alto, California, unincorporated Stanford University lands, and the northwest corner of Los Altos Hills, California and is part of the Santa Clara County Expressway System.\n\n*Route description*\n\nG3 begins in the west at its interchange with I-280 in Los Altos Hills just south of Stanford University. It proceeds northeast as a four lane expressway over the rolling hills of Stanford University until it reaches Foothill Expressway (G5) with which it shares an at-grade intersection. East of Foothill Expressway, G3 descends down into the more urban areas of the lower peninsula going through the industrialized area of the Stanford Research Park located in Palo Alto. The road along this section has a reduced speed limit and several turnoffs along its length until it reaches El Camino Real (SR 82).\n\nAfter SR 82, Oregon Expressway branches from Page Mill Road, which becomes a short two-lane street, and G3 follows Oregon Expressway under Caltrain tracks and onward for the remainder of its northeastward journey. Oregon Expressway resumes expressway status with limited access confined mainly to large intersections. G3 reaches its eastern terminus at its junction with US 101.\n\nPage Mill Road (no longer designated G3) continues southwest of I-280 for 6 miles (9.7 km), a twisting two-lane road that climbs to Skyline Boulevard (SR 35) at the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains. It passes the entrance to Palo Alto's Foothills Park (which is accessible to Palo Alto residents and their guests only) and the Monte Bello and Los Trancos Open Space Preserves. Under the name West Alpine Road, the road descends west of Skyline Boulevard to a turn-off that leads to Portola Redwoods State Park, where the original Page (saw)mill is located. No artifacts remain at the mill site, which is accessible only by trail, either from Portola Redwoods state park or from Skyline Boulevard (SR 35)."  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_County_Routes_in_zone_G#cite_note-Fava-2)	In the city there are many areas of lush vegetation serving as habitats to fungi. Some of these are private, others are greenbelt, and some are parks, and some of the unincorporated lands of Stanford University.  To the West of I-280 Page Mill Rd. winds through some beautiful open spaces and parks, including Los Trancos Preserve, Mote Bello Opens Space, and  Foothills Park. Beyond Hwy 35/Skyline Blvd, Old Page Mill Trail continues the route through Skyline Ridge Regional Open Space and private lands towards the Pacific Coast. Native trees include Coast Live Oak, Tanoak, Douglas Fir, Redwood, and Madrone.  Eucalyptus groves are scattered in areas that were logged or cleared.  Occasionally, snow falls in the higher elevations near Skyline Drive during cold winters.

357	1299	1		The City of Monroe lies 17 miles east of Everett on Highway 2 and 10 miles northeast of Bothell/Woodinville on Highway 522.  With a diverse population of over 16,000 the city has become the center of trade, business and professional services for East Snohomish County.\n\nThe City is located in a river valley and surrounded by forested open space.  Our parks and public places are beautifully maintained.  Opportunities for fishing, white-water rafting, other water sports, hiking, skiing, climbing, and camping are only minutes away.  The mountain wilderness area east of Monroe is a panorama of waterfalls, streams and mountain lakes.\n\nMonroe is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. The population as of 17,304 at the 2010 census.\n\nThe history of Monroe is intertwined with that of the Great Northern Railway which pushed over the Cascade Range at Stevens Pass and worked its way down the Skykomish River Valley.[3]\n\nPrior to that time the main settlement in the area had been located about one mile west of where the downtown eventually grew up and was known as Park Place. However, the city’s merchants relocated when the railroad survey was completed to have better access to the new transportation corridor. The new development was originally known as Tye City, but became Monroe when Park Place’s main store, the one containing the U.S. Post Office, relocated and took up the name "Monroe at Park Place” in honor of James Monroe the nation's fifth president. Because the U.S. Postal Department would not allow any new post offices to use double names, the post office, and eventually the town, became known simply as “Monroe.”[4]\n\nBy 1893 the city had become an important stop on the rail line and was best known for the GN Greenhouses, which grew flowers for the passengers to purchase. That same year, Snohomish County built the County Poor Farm where today’s Evergreen State Fairgrounds are located; the city's first hospital was built where Valley General Hospital stands today. 1894 saw the construction of the first high bridge over the Skykomish River and 1896 the construction of the first church. In 1899 the grammar school was relocated from its old site in Park Place to a new site in Monroe and the town’s newspaper, The Monroe Monitor, began publication on January 14 of the same year. On September 16, 1901 a fire destroyed the only complete block of business in the city.\nCarnation Condensery Stack (photographed 2009).\n\nThe economic area of the city saw a series of development as well. While the city was still in its infancy, many sawmills were constructed to take advantage of the area’s old growth cedar and cedar shakes became the main product. However, as the timber played out and the logging industry slowly moved away, agriculture became the area’s new industry and berry farms began to flourish. Because of the lush valley grasses, dairy farms too moved into the area and soon several creameries began production. Evidence of this industry can still be seen today as the giant smokestack of the Carnation Condensery, a factory which was destroyed by fire in the 1940s, still stands in the middle of what is today a grocery store parking lot at the intersection of Main Street and US Route 2. It is a lone reminder of this forgotten industrial era and, despite its age, it remains much taller than any other structure in the city.\nOld City Hall, built 1908, now (2009) home to the Monroe Historical Society and Monroe Historical Museum.\n\nThe City of Monroe officially voted to incorporate on December 20, 1902 and the new city counted 325 people in its population. In 1910, around the same time as the construction of the Carnation Condensery, Washington State chose Monroe as the site of the Washington State Reformatory.\n\nThe Great Depression struck Monroe as it did elsewhere in the nation and much of the town's industry closed down. As a result, the city fathers applied for national funds and established programs to help the town. The funds built a school, which can still be seen on Main Street, as well as road improvements. In 1941, the first fair was held in Monroe, known as the Cavalcade of the Valleys, at the County Poor Farm. Although interrupted by World War II, the fair resumed in 1946 with the help of many local residents such as Mr. and Mrs. Shine Peters, then owners of Monroe Floral, who helped plant all the flowers shrubs and trees that decorated the grounds from their nursery. Local farmers and Grange members' contributions helped establish many traditions the Evergreen State Fair continues to take pride in. The annual fair remains an important part of the city’s culture today.\nThis old house near the center of Monroe has been more recently used as a shop.\n\nAfter the depression and war, industry did not return to the city and the town became ever more oriented towards agriculture. It continued to grow, albeit slowly, throughout much of the 1950s and '60s. In April 1965 a major earthquake struck Western Washington and the original Monroe High School and its annex were so severely damaged that they later had to be demolished. The new high school opened in 1968 and served the city until a new larger High School had to be built in 1999.[5]\n\nIn the early 1970s Monroe became the terminus for State Route 522 (Originally SR202, before being realigned into SR522), which offers a more direct connection to Interstate 405 and larger cities to the south. This has opened the city up and helped to establish it as a true bedroom community. The highway meets up with U.S. Route 2 in the town and the intersection is often filled with intrastate traffic.\nThe Doloff-Key building at the very center of old Monroe, the corner of Main and Lewis Streets, dates back to 1901. Pictured here in 2009.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century, Monroe saw growth in unexpected new proportions as many large strip malls and major retailers have built new complexes along Highway 2. The city's residential areas have greatly expanded as well and the highway has become the scene of major gridlock, especially during summer months and major holidays. At the time of this writing, a bypass is being considered but no firm plans have been agreed upon.\n\nThe new developments have added to the city and the influx of people into the surrounding area has changed, but not erased much of the city’s charm. The old part of town stands much as it always has, on Main Street away from the busy highway, and has managed to preserve much of its small town character. Trains still regularly pass through the town on their way across Stevens Pass and the sound of their horns is a common feature of life in the city.\n\nIn recent years Monroe’s Old Town district has begun[when?] a revitalization program.[6][7]\n\nMonroe has also been[when?] host to a few Hollywood films, such as The Ring, The Ring Two, and The Butterfly Effect.\n\nOnce per year from 1995 until 2000, the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series held a race at the Evergreen Speedway located at the Evergreen State Fairgrounds.\n[edit] \n\nGeography\n\nMonroe is located at 47°51′28″N 121°59′18″W﻿ / ﻿47.857722°N 121.988364°W﻿ / 47.857722; -121.988364 (47.857722, -121.988364).[8]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.8 square miles (15.0 km2), of which, 5.8 square miles (15.0 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2) of it (0.52%) is water.\n\nAs stated above, The Washington State Reformatory was originally built in 1910. It was originally intended to house young offenders, keeping them separate from the hardcore older offenders. In 1981, the Special Offender Center was opened to treat offenders with mental health issues. Twin Rivers Correctional Center opened in 1994 as a 500-bed medium-custody facility. The Minimum-Security Unit opened in 1997 to house minimum-custody offenders. In 1998, the four facilities merged into the Monroe Correctional Complex under one Superintendent. The facilities were re-named the Washington State Reformatory Unit (WSRU), Twin Rivers Unit (providing the state's only male sex-offender treatment program in the prison system), Special Offender Unit (for mental health treatment) and the Minimum-Security Unit retained its name. The Intensive Management Unit (IMU) opened in 2007 as the newest addition to the Monroe Correctional Complex. The 100-bed Intensive Management Unit will house behaviorally difficult-to-manage offenders in a highly-controlled environment. Since the reformatory first opened, the prison has employed a large number of locals.[9]		Verpa, Gyromitra		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe,_Washington\n\nhttp://www.ci.monroe.wa.us/

Bordered by Seattle, Lake Forest Park, Mountlake Terrace, and the Puget Sound.\n\nShoreline is a city in King County, Washington, United States, 15 miles (24 km) north of Downtown Seattle. As of the 2000 census, the population was 53,025, making it the 14th largest city in the state of Washington.\n\nBased on per capita income, one of the more reliable measures of affluence, Shoreline ranks 91st of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked.\n\nHistory\n\nShoreline began in 1890 with the platting of the neighborhood of Richmond Beach, on Puget Sound, in anticipation of the arrival of the Great Northern Railway the next year. Over the next two decades, Shoreline was connected to Seattle via the Seattle-Everett Interurban streetcar line (1906) and a newly paved North Trunk Road (now Aurora Avenue N., State Route 99) (1913), helping to increase its population.\n\nThe name “Shoreline” first came to be applied to this stretch of unincorporated King County in 1944, when it was given to the school district. As the school district boundaries stretched from “Shore to Shore” (Puget Sound to Lake Washington) and “Line to Line” (the old Seattle city limit of 85th St to the Snohomish County Line). Though the modern borders of the city do not stretch to Lake Washington, the area kept the “Shoreline” name.\n\nAfter the incorporation of Lake Forest Park in 1961, the remainder of the Shoreline School District remained an unincorporated portion of King County. Fifty-one years after it had been named, on August 31, 1995 Shoreline was officially incorporated as a code city and adopted the council-manager form of government.

As the school district boundaries stretched from “Shore to Shore” (Puget Sound to Lake Washington) and “Line to Line” (the old Seattle city limit of 85th St to the Snohomish County Line). Though the modern borders of the city do not stretch to Lake Washington, the area kept the “Shoreline” name.\n\nAfter the incorporation of Lake Forest Park in 1961, the remainder of the Shoreline School District remained an unincorporated portion of King County.

Over the next two decades, Shoreline was connected to Seattle via the Seattle-Everett Interurban streetcar line (1906) and a newly paved North Trunk Road (now Aurora Avenue N., State Route 99) (1913), helping to increase its population.\n\nThe name “Shoreline” first came to be applied to this stretch of unincorporated King County in 1944, when it was given to the school district. As the school district boundaries stretched from “Shore to Shore” (Puget Sound to Lake Washington) and “Line to Line” (the old Seattle city limit of 85th St to the Snohomish County Line). Though the modern borders of the city do not stretch to Lake Washington, the area kept the “Shoreline” name.\n\nAfter the incorporation of Lake Forest Park in 1961, the remainder of the Shoreline School District remained an unincorporated portion of King County. Fifty-one years after it had been named, on August 31, 1995 Shoreline was officially incorporated as a code city and adopted the council-manager form of government.

390	2541	4	Wikipedia	Index is a town in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. The population was 157 at the 2000 census.\n\nPrior to settlement by westerners, the Skykomish Indians lived in the area between Sultan and Index. They spoke Lushootseed; fishing the Skykomish River was an important part of their economy.\n\nLogging and lumber booms in the latter half of the 19th century led to the growth of minor settlements in the eastern part of what became Snohomish County in 1861. A gold strike in 1889 at nearby Monte Cristo fueled another influx of prospectors and settlers.[3] The town is named for nearby Mount Index.\n\nIndex was officially incorporated on October 11, 1907.\n[edit] Geography\n\nIndex is located in the western foothills of the Cascade Mountains; the summit of Mount Index is located 3 miles (4.8 km) south of the town. The Index Town Walls, granite cliffs up to 500 feet (150 m) high, are located on the north edge of the town. These walls are a major destination for rock climbing, and are especially well known for a variety of high-quality cracks for climbing.[4] According to the United States Census Bureau, Index has a total area of 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2), all of it land.\n\nIndex is located on the North Fork Skykomish River, just above its confluence with the main channel of the Skykomish River. The Skykomish River's Sunset Falls, a nearly 300-foot-long (91 m) granite chute that drops some 100 feet (30 m), is located approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) from the town (though on the South Fork Skykomish River).\n\nThe town is located 1 mile (1.6 km) north of US Highway 2, approximately 25 miles (40 km) west of Stevens Pass. The BNSF railroad, formerly the Great Northern Railway, runs through the middle of the town. And was once an important stop for the mining (particularly Monte Cristo and Gelena) and timber activities north of its location.\n[edit] Demographics\nHistorical populations\nCensus \tPop. \t\t%±\n1910 \t417 \t\t\n—\n1920 \t412 \t\t−1.2%\n1930 \t381 \t\t−7.5%\n1940 \t217 \t\t−43.0%\n1950 \t211 \t\t−2.8%\n1960 \t158 \t\t−25.1%\n1970 \t169 \t\t7.0%\n1980 \t147 \t\t−13.0%\n1990 \t139 \t\t−5.4%\n2000 \t157 \t\t12.9%\nEst. 2009 \t169 \t\t7.6%\n\nAs of the census[1] of 2000, there were 157 people, 75 households, and 39 families residing in the town.

391	1679	1		Observatory Hill (also called Little Saanich Mountain) is 224 m high between Beaver/Elk and Prospect Lakes. The total area of the property is 71.4 ha. This is a federal property and the site of the NRC Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics. \n\nThe observatory on the top of The Hill was built in 1918 and houses the telescope with the mirror of 183 cm in diameter. The telescope was for about two years the largest telescope in the world.\n\n\n	The plant communities are typical of the Coastal Douglas-fir Biogeoclimatic Zone. The drier western and southern slopes in the upper parts of Observatory Hill are open rock outcrops with a mosaic of mossy/grassy vegetation and several stands of Garry oak (Quercus garryana). The western slopes with Quercus garryana represent younger stages of the Garry oak (=White Oregon Oak) vegetation after the 1934 fire.\n\nThe mixed forest of Observatory Hill can be classified as mid-successional (45-80 years). Forest age is a factor in determining species composition of macrofungi, especially of the mycorrhizal fungi. However, the greatest richness in species was found in more complex, late- successional mixed forests.\n\nStands dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are the major vegetation forest types in the study area. In the lower, colluvial slopes the forests belong to the Pseudotsuga menziesii – Gaultheria shallon and Pseudotsuga menziesii – Mahonia nervosa site series; whereas on the upper parts of the top plateau the forests belong to the drier Pseudotsuga menziesii – Melica subulata site series. Large area of this forest has never been logged and is a good example of the drier Douglas-fir forest.\n\nThe area at the eastern base of the hill below the access road is covered with wetter Douglas-fir forest (Thuja plicata – Eurhynchium oreganum site series) with scattered big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum). Big-leaf maple forms a small stand along a small ephemeral stream at the bottom of this area.

392	2644	1		Bastyr University was established as the John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in 1978 in Seattle, Washington (USA) by Sheila Quinn, Joseph Pizzorno, ND, LM; William Mitchell, ND; and Les Griffith, ND, LM. It is named after John Bastyr, a pioneering naturopathic physician and chiropractor in the Seattle area who was instrumental in keeping interest in naturopathic medicine alive through the 1960s. It is one of seven accredited naturopathic medical schools and has offered baccalaureate, masters and doctoral degree programs since 1989.[1][2]\n\nIn 1984, the school was renamed Bastyr College, and in 1994, it became Bastyr University. Bastyr offers degree programs in naturopathic medicine, nutrition, acupuncture and Oriental medicine, exercise science and wellness, health psychology, integrated human biology, midwifery, nutrition and clinical health psychology, and herbal sciences. The university also offers certificate programs in Chinese herbal medicine and holistic landscape design (permaculture).\n\nIn 1996, Bastyr relocated to its current location in the Saint Thomas Center, a former Catholic seminary building in the Inglewood-Finn Hill neighborhood of Kenmore, Washington. Its campus is almost completely surrounded by Saint Edward State Park's dense fir and hemlock forest. In November, 2005, the university completed the purchase of this property, which it had been leasing from the Archdiocese of Seattle.\n\nBastyr also operates a natural medicine clinic, Bastyr Center for Natural Health, in Seattle's Wallingford neighborhood. The clinic offers naturopathic medicine, acupuncture and Oriental medicine, nutrition counseling, Chinese herbal medicine, and more, and treats many types of health conditions.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastyr_University
393	2645	1		Saint Edward State Park is a 316-acre (128 ha)-park in Kenmore, Washington and is part of the Washington State Park System. Before becoming a Catholic seminary and later a state park, the area was logged in the 19th century and again in the 1920s. A series of trails runs through the park for bicyclists and hikers. The forest canopy is primarily made up of the Coast Douglas-fir, Western Redcedar, Bigleaf Maple, Pacific Madrone and Western Hemlock. Its dense carpet includes many varieties of fern (mainly Western Sword Fern), shrub and moss. It is flanked on the west by an undeveloped beach on Lake Washington. The park surrounds the Saint Thomas Center, which houses Bastyr University.\n\nThe park's most singular feature is the Saint Edward Seminary, listed on the Washington State Heritage Register since 1997[1] and added in April 2007 to the National Register of Historic Places. This large, historic building has fallen into disrepair in recent years. It is not currently accessible to the public except by special arrangement, e.g. renting the refectory for special events.\n\nOther facilities include the indoor Carole Ann Wald Memorial Pool, which was built in the late 1960s with funding from a seminarian's family, and named after the seminarian's sister and donors' daughter. The pool has been operated in recent years by concessionaires and, unfortunately, was mothballed December 31, 2009, pending a new operator and/or a greater consortium of support from SESP near-neighbor citizenry, municipalities, and other sponsors.\n\nThe status of CAWM Pool is monitored at Support Northshore Aquatics, and on Facebook as "Friends of Carole Ann Wald Memorial Pool".\n\nCity of Kenmore, Evergreen Health, and Bastyr University have helped underwrite the CAWM Pool from 2003-2008. In 2009 only Evergreen Health and Bastyr University were continuing partners.\n\nThe gymnasium and an outdoor stone sanctuary ("the Grotto") both date from the original 1930's construction period. A baseball field and a soccer field lay south of the seminary building.\n\nThe park boasts the largest children's playground in the state, built primarily by local volunteers in 2003.[2] It was recently named one of the Top 5 playgrounds in Washington State.[3]\n\nThe park is day-use only, and no camping is permitted. Dogs are allowed at Saint Edward State Park but state law requires that they be on a physical leash (8 feet or less) at all times.\n\nA local citizens group, Friends of Saint Edward State Park (FoSESP), assists the Park Department in scheduling park usage, but is barred by contract from advocacy.\n\nAnother citizen group, Saint Edward Environmental Learning Center (SEELC) is dedicated to creating a sustainable future through park preservation, community collaboration, and innovative educational experiences for all ages.[4] The Kenmore Reporter covered SEELC's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream as part of its environmental-education program, which consists of a variety of courses at Saint Edward State Park between Spring and Fall each year.[5]\n[edit] Renovation\n\nIn 2005, Washington State Parks began a land use planning project for the park.[6] Also known as Classification and Management Planning (CAMP), the project addresses overall visitor experiences, natural and cultural resources, use of the park’s buildings, recreation fields and trails, and other topics of interest to the community and customers.\n\nBecause the "Friends" group is barred from advocacy, another citizens group, Citizens for Saint Edward State Park, C4SEP, emerged to contribute public comment and ideas.\n\nA proposal by McMenamins to develop the main building into a hotel, restaurant, and conference center was withdrawn in spring of 2007.\n\nWith elevated attention from C4SEP the State Legislature allocated $500,000 to evaluate the declining condition of the seminary building, and $500,000 toward much needed and previously deferred maintenance.\n\nWith the newly available injection of funding, State Parks began an RFQ process with architectural firms Spring 2007, moving forward toward a timely evaluation, creating an opportunity for a wider array of prospective uses.[7]\n\nBassetti Architects were selected to evaluate and report on the Seminary building.\n\nRanger/Park Manager Mohammad Mostafavinassab reports (April 2008) that an additional $1.7 million is being funded for Phase 1 (repair/replace foundation and field drainage, and repair foundation), and to begin Phase 2 (Exterior repairs).\n\nIn 2010 Friends of Saint Edward State Park and Kenmore Heritage Society began working together on the Interpretive Sign project, drawing on KHS's experience with the Kenmore History Path at Log Boom Park.\n[edit] History\ncirca 1931\n\nFrom the 1920s until 1977, the land on which Saint Edward State Park sits was owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle. From 1931, it was developed and used for a seminary by the Sulpician Order.[1] The St. Edward Seminary was constructed in 1931, followed in 1958 by the Saint Thomas Seminary, and pool in 1969. Due to declining enrollments, the seminaries closed in 1977.[1] Most of the land was sold to the state of Washington, with the support of then-governor Dixy Lee Ray.\n\n\nThe remainder of the land, which includes the Saint Thomas Seminary (now Saint Thomas Center) continued under the ownership of the archdiocese until November 2005, when its tenant, Bastyr University, completed their purchase of the property.

399	2807	1		Port Gamble is an unincorporated community on the northwestern shore of the Kitsap Peninsula in Kitsap County, Washington, United States. It is also a small, similarly named bay, along which the community lies, near the entrance to Hood Canal. The unincorporated communities of Port Gamble and Little Boston, part of Kitsap County, lie on either side of the mouth of this bay. The Port Gamble Historic District is a U.S. National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe community of Port Gamble has a wide range of shops from antiques to a tea shop to an old-fashioned general store. It is a popular tourist destination, due to its location near Bremerton, Port Townsend, Bainbridge Island, and Seattle and its downtown.[3] Port Gamble is also home to the grave of Gustave Englebrecht, the first U.S. Navy sailor to die in the Pacific.[4]\n\nBattle of Port Gamble\n\nThe body of water was named by the Wilkes Expedition in 1841 after U.S. Navy Lt. Robert Gamble. The community, originally known as Teekalet, was founded as a company town by Josiah Keller, William Talbot, and Andrew Pope's Puget Mill Company in 1853.[5]\nBattle of Port Gamble\nPart of the Puget Sound War\nAmerican Indian Wars\nDate \t1857\nLocation \tPort Gamble, Washington, Puget Sound\nResult \tUnited States victory\nBelligerents\n United States \tNisqually\nMuckleshoot\nPuyallup\nKlickitat.\nStrength\nLand:\nunknown sailors\nSea:\n1 steamer \tunknown warriors\nCasualties and losses\n1 killed \t26 killed,\nunknown wounded\n[show]v · d · e\n19th century Asia/Pacific conflicts involving the United States\nAmerican Indian Wars\nBattle of Woody Point\nWar of 1812\nAction off James Island · Action off Charles Island · Battle of Valparaiso\nFirst Sumatran Expedition\nFriendship Incident · Battle of Quallah Battoo\nSecond Sumatran Expedition\nEclipse Incident · Bombardment of Quallah Battoo · Battle of Muckie\nWilkes Expedition\nBattle of Malolo\nCapture of Monterey\nMexican–American War\nCalifornia Campaign · Pacific Coast Campaign\nPiracy in China\nBattle of Ty-ho Bay · Antelope Incident\nPuget Sound War\nBattle of Seattle · Battle of Port Gamble\nSecond Opium War\nFirst Battle of Canton · Battle of the Pearl River Forts · Second Battle of Taku Forts\nFijian Expedition\nBattle of Somatti\nAmerican Civil War\nPacific Coast Theatre · Capture of J.

When the warriors refused to hand over those among them who had attacked the Puget Sound Native American communities, Massachusetts landed a shore party and a battle ensued in which 26 natives and 1 sailor were killed. In the aftermath of this, Colonel Isaac Ebey, the first settler on Whidbey Island, was shot and beheaded on August 11, 1857 by a Haida raiding party in revenge for the killing of a native chief during similar raids the year before. British authorities demurred on pursuing or attacking the northern tribes as they passed northward through British waters off Victoria and Ebey's killers were never caught.[6][7]\n\nThe first school in the county went up in 1859, and the community took its present name in 1868. In 1966, the town of Port Gamble was designated a National Historic Landmark District.[8] In 1985, Pope & Talbot, the successor company to Puget Mill, split into Pope & Talbot and Pope Resources, the latter of which took over the site and the sawmill. In 1995, the mill shut down after 142 years, making it the longest operating sawmill in the country.[9]\nWalker-Ames house in Port Gamble, WA.\n\nPort Gamble was the setting of and filming location for the 2010 film ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction.\n[edit] Events\n\nThe annual Old Mill Days festival takes place over the course of three days during late September and encompasses the entire downtown area. The event includes craft and food stands, a logging show, fireworks, and various other forms of entertainment.[10]				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Gamble,_Washington

401	2828	1		University Village is an upscale shopping center in Seattle, Washington, built at the south corner of Ravenna neighborhood.[1] The 24 acre (97,000 m²) shopping center was built in 1956 across NE 45th Street on an earlier part of the Montlake Landfill (since 1911, 1922–1966; home of J. P. Patches 1958-1981), taking out what remained of the Union Bay Marsh that was drained by the lowering of Lake Washington as a result of the opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal (1913–1916).[2] Some wetland was later partially restored as the Union Bay Natural Area with the Center for Urban Horticulture.[3]\n\nUniversity Village was originally developed by Continental Inc. who also developed Westwood Village in West Seattle and Aurora Village in Shoreline, WA.\n\nUntil the early 1990s, the character of University Village was decidedly different. Most of its businesses were small, and the chain stores were all local: Ernst Hardware and Malmo Nursery, Lamonts department store (acquired by Gottschalks in 2000), Pay 'n Save Drugs (sold to PayLess Drug in the early 1990s), and QFC supermarket. There was even a bowling alley, Village Lanes. Many of the businesses began to falter toward the end of the 1980s, however, and in 1993 the owners of the mall decided to sell. The chairman of QFC and a partner bought it, and tenants such as those mentioned above began to move out. U-Village, as it is colloquially known, no longer has a hardware store, but features upscale national stores such as Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn, Miller-Pollard, Banana Republic, and Crate & Barrel instead (as well as related local specialty stores). Despite this, 61% of U-Village merchants are still local. (The Ernst and Pay n' Save corporate chains went out of business in the 1990s; adjacent QFC still nominally exists, but as a division of Kroger.)\n\nAnchor tenants today are Barnes & Noble, local and family-owned Bartell Drugs (since 1890),[4] Crate & Barrel, The Gap, and Pottery Barn.[5] Significant adjacent anchors are the Seattle QFC flagship store, a large Safeway, and an Office Depot. In 1991, neighborhood activists initiated a campaign with the City to "daylight" Ravenna Creek through Ravenna Park to Lake Washington, but the segment from the park to the University of Washington (UW) and the Union Bay Natural Area was successfully blocked by the owners of University Village.[6]\n\nThe campus of the UW is to the west and south, the neighborhood of Bryant farther to the east, and the neighborhood of Ravenna to the north,[7] but portions of the surrounding neighborhoods are often referred to as being in "University Village" themselves, approximately west to 22nd Avenue NE, north to NE 55th Street, and east to Union Bay Place NE and 30th Avenue NE. The area's principal arterials are 25th Avenue NE and NE 45th Street; 35th Avenue is a minor arterial. Collector arterials are NE Blakeley-Union Bay Place NE and NE 55th streets.[8]		Leccinum, Marasmius, Psathyrella, Tubaria		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Village,_Seattle

403	2878	1		The University District (commonly, the U District) is a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, so named because the main campus of the University of Washington (UW) is located there. The UW moved in two years after the area was annexed to Seattle, while much of the area was still clear cut forest or stump farmland. The district of neighborhoods grew with the university to become like a smaller version of urban American cities.\n\nLike all Seattle districts, the boundaries of the University District are informal; by common usage, the University District is bounded on the west by Interstate 5; on the east by 25th Avenue NE; on the south by the Lake Washington Ship Canal; and on the north by NE Ravenna Boulevard. It also includes, east of these boundaries, a small district on the north shore of Union Bay, bounded on the north by NE 45th Street and on the east by 35th Avenue NE. This extension consists mainly of the "east campus" and extensive parking lots of the University.[3] Its main commercial street, University Way NE, is known throughout the city as "The Ave" in the "U District".\n\nSome parts of the University District have had names of their own. For example, today "University Heights" mainly designates a former school used as a community center; a 1905 map shows the name as applying specifically to the area bounded by what are now NE 45th Street to the south, NE 55th Street to the north, Brooklyn Avenue NE to the west, and 15th Avenue NE to the east.[4]\n[edit] History\n\nWhat is now the University District has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE—10,000 years ago). Prominent Native American Duwamish villages of the Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish nations were on a then-larger Portage Bay at what is now called Brooklyn Avenue, and the other on a larger Union Bay, near the present UW power plant (which is across from the UW IMA building), around the north shores a mile farther than today, and shores east of what is now the Union Bay Natural Area. (See also adjacent Ravenna neighborhood.) The Duwamish,[5] ("People of the Inside") tribe had the prominent village of SWAH-tsoo-gweel ("portage") on then-adjacent Union Bay, and what is now Ravenna was their backyard before the arrival of European settlers.[6] Villages were diffuse. In spring, people dispersed from their winter villages of longhouses to camps, gathering in summer for salmon. Gaps in the forest were maintained to encourage game and food supplies. Such "prairies" (anthrogenic grasslands) were cultivated in what is now the University District.[7] They were connected by a well-travelled path along what is now the Lake Washington Ship Canal (1883, 1916).\n\nSurveyors noted several large Douglas-firs and western red cedars (given that large trees were not unusual back then, these must have been especially large). The U. District was first surveyed in 1855, and its first white settlers arrived 12 years later. In 1890, that part of the neighborhood due west of the present UW campus was laid out as the Brooklyn Addition. One year later much of the land north of the Ship Canal, including Brooklyn, was annexed to Seattle. The UW moved from Downtown in 1893, and the first university building was built in 1895.\n\nAn 1894 report describes a train wreck just west of the current University District. Latona has now been cut off from the University by Interstate 5.\n\n    August 20, 1894. Wreck on [the] Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern just west of Latone [now Latona Avenue]. Freight train from Gilman [now Snoqualmie] hit a cow. [Trainload was a] [m]ixer freight train, 10 co[a]l cars, logs and box cars. Train had slowed down at Brooklyn [Avenue] for cows. Engineer saw cows on a bank beyond Latona looking (?) one another[!]. One cow was tossed over [the] bank and hit the track just as [the] engine came by. [The] [e]ngine was raised off the track[,] and when it came down [the] wheels went off the rails. Engineer reversed but [it] was too late. [The] [c]oal tender shot ahead[,] tearing part of [the engine] car [(cab)] off and decapitating [the] fireman and killing [the] brakeman. Engineer and coal passer [were][8] unhurt. Steam and dust enveloped the derailed cars. Engineer ran to Fremont to telegraph to stop [the] evening passenger train[;] also [illegible] Engineer claimed train going 20 miles per hr.[9]\n\nSeattle, Lake Shore and Eastern train wreck in the University District, 20 August 1894.\n\nThe name "Brooklyn" began to fade soon thereafter. Electric trolley tracks had been laid up Columbus Avenue (later 14th Avenue) in 1892, and the neighborhood soon began to be called "University Station" after the heated waiting house at the corner of what is now NE 42nd Street (1895). The name Brooklyn is not lost, however, for Brooklyn Avenue NE runs parallel to University Way, one block west.[1] North and west of the campus, within the University District, the University Heights—a name now little used—was named for its elementary school (1903–c.1988; since 1990 the University Heights Center for the Community Association, hosts numerous activities small and large from the University District Community Clean Up to the University District Farmer's Market.[10]\n\nBut for the trolley, in early decades of the U. District Downtown was a trek, a boat, and a horsecart ride away. Given these early transportation difficulties, the U. District was largely self-sufficient, with area businesses for people with ties to the University. Construction of family homes increased in the early 1900s, as did churches, theaters, stores, and a YMCA. The district's first bank and the first local public library opened in 1906, the modest library organized by local merchants.[11]\n\nAs a result of a contest held by the University Commercial Club in 1919, 14th Avenue (by then already known as "The Avenue" or "The Ave") was renamed University Way, and the neighborhood was renamed the University District (1919).[1] The neighborhood's north-south arterials are (from west to east) Roosevelt Way NE (southbound)), 11th Avenue NE (northbound), Brooklyn Avenue NE, University Way NE, and 15th Avenue NE. NE Pacific, 45th, and part of 50th streets are principal east-west arterials, NE Campus Parkway is a minor east-west arterial, running only west of the campus.[12]\n\nOn April 20, 2002 Layne Staley, the singer and frontman of the grunge band Alice in Chains was found dead in his University District apartment. An autopsy report later concluded that Staley had died on or around April 5, 2002 after injecting a mixture of heroin and cocaine known as a speedball.[13]\n[edit] Contemporary\nThis 1980s sign painted on the side of the 1934 Blue Moon Tavern commemorates its association with the counterculture of the 1960s; the small street sign at upper right declares the alley to be "Roethke Mews" after poet Theodore Roethke, a regular at the tavern when he was a professor at the University in the 1950s and early 1960s.[14]\n\nThe U District is characterized by the annual May U District Street Fair [1], the first of its kind in 1971,[15] started by local merchant and dedicated peace activist Andy Shiga in 1970,[16] and the University District Farmers Market [2], Seattle's first (1993) and largest local farmers-only neighborhood market.[17] Andy Shiga (1919–1993) of Shiga's Imports and local attorney Calmar McCune (1911–1996) long supported development of the alternative character of the U District.[18] The ASUW Experimental College [3], founded in the college culture of 1968 by a group of UW students seeking education in areas not found in the traditional university environment, is now the largest nonprofit student-run program of its kind. Open to all, it has contributed to the cultural ambience of the U District ever since.[19] The Blue Moon Tavern has become an unofficial cultural landmark, since 1934.[20] Big Time is Seattle's original brewpub (1988).[21] Opened in 1966 Dante's Bar&Nightclub is another popular venue and is known as "a U-District tradition." Six theatres (including the Neptune built in 1921,[22] the Varsity since 1940;[23] the Grand Illusion Cinema (founded in a former dental lab in 1968 by Randy Finley,[24] now owned and run by dedicated volunteers);[25] and the (locally-owned) Scarecrow Video, the largest video store on the West Coast[26] further characterize the neighborhood. The U District is second only to Capitol Hill as an epicenter for NoCat [4] Free Wi-Fi with the global Seattle Wireless [5] project.\n\nThe neighborhood's skyline landmarks (other than the UW campus) are its tallest buildings: UW Tower (formerly Safeco Plaza) and the Meany Hotel (which became the Best Western University Tower and is now known as Hotel Deca). The former, originally headquarters of Safeco Corporation, is located at the corner of Brooklyn Avenue NE and NE 45th Street. It was built in 1973, and at 22 stories high is the city's tallest building outside Downtown. The latter is Art Deco (1931, restored). The architect Robert Reamer gave every room a corner window.[27] A jewel of the neighborhood is the formal Neo-classical Carnegie Library (1910) on Roosevelt Way at 50th Street.[11]\nThe U-District, looking northeast from Queen Anne. UW Tower is the tall building in the center, with the Hotel Deca (originally the Meany Hotel) to its left. The Interstate 5 Ship Canal Bridge is in the foreground.\n\nIn recent decades, the University District has suffered commercial decline, due at least in significant part to the more competitive planning, capital investment, and popularity of the University Village shopping center east of the campus, and Northgate Mall about 1-1/2 miles (2-1/2 km) north beside I-5. From 2002 to 2004, the city and the neighborhood have made some steps countering this trend by giving the Ave a repaving facelift including the addition of benches, bus bulbs, and period lighting.[28] The addition of benches represented the reversal of a decades-long neighborhood trend away from providing free places to sit.\n\nStarting in 2016, the district will be serviced by an extension of Link Light Rail called the University Link.[29] The light rail line will connect the U District with Capitol Hill, Downtown Seattle, Rainier Valley, and Sea-Tac airport. There are currently plans for one station located on Montlake Boulevard in front of Husky Stadium and another on Brooklyn.[30]\n\nThe local year-round and seasonal homeless population, referred to as "Ave Rats", is well-known around Seattle. (See The Ave.)\n\nDue to the size of the UW Greek system, fraternity and sorority members make up a sizeable portion of the local cafes' and bars' clientele, especially such establishments as Earl's and Fourno's,[citation needed] though well outnumbered by the Seattle campus student body of more than 39,250.[31] Other bars have a wider base of patrons, including the College Inn (built for the Alaska-Yukon Exposition in 1909)[32] and the Irish Emigrant. The University District is home to all of the UW's fraternity and sorority houses, most of them clustered along 17th Avenue NE between NE 45th and 50th Streets ("Frat Row" or "Greek Row"). On Thursday (when many Greek parties are held to deter high-schoolers) and Friday nights, it is not uncommon for parties to spill out into the local streets within the area. This reputation draws many crashers, and most of the recent instances of gun violence, injury, and property damage at UW student parties have been due to party crashers getting ejected, in the context of readily available alcohol (and recreational drugs) at large student parties.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_District,_Seattle

It is located at the University of Washington campus at the intersection of N.E. 45th Street and 17th Avenue N.E. in Seattle, Washington, USA's University District. It is the only major natural history museum in the Pacific Northwest and the state's oldest museum. Its collection numbers over 12 million artifacts and specimens, including totem poles, gemstones, and dinosaur fossils.\n\nThe roots of the Burke Museum can be traced back to an amateur natural history club founded in the early 1880s, known as the Young Naturalists' Society. The YNS began collaborating with the Washington Territorial University through natural science professor Orson Bennett Johnson. Johnson became an advocate for the professionalization of the society and helped them increase their understanding of natural history and refocus their efforts on collecting, educating, and displaying objects to and for the public. With Johnson's guidance, the group's membership, natural history collections, and ambitions grew, resulting in the creation of Seattle's first natural history museum on the downtown campus of WTU (later to becomes the University of Washington). Over the years, the YNS and their museum expanded their collections to include newly discovered marine specimens, and expanded their membership to include a number of women.\n\nThe original museum was shut down when the WTU moved north to become the University of Washington. Several members followed the school and organized an on-campus museum. In 1899 the Washington state legislature named this new organization the Washington State Museum. Following this development, the Young Naturalists' Society was disbanded in 1904.\n\nHowever, the new Washington State Museum continued to lack a permanent home for its collections until 1962, when the Burke's present building was constructed (designed by James Chiarelli). Funds for the structure came from a grant from the National Science Foundation and a generous bequest from the estate of Caroline McGilvra Burke, at which point the museum was renamed in honor of her late husband Judge Thomas Burke.\n[edit] Mission\n\nAccording to its website, "The Burke Museum is dedicated to creating a better understanding of the world and our place in it. The museum is responsible for Washington State collections of natural and culture heritage, and for sharing the knowledge that makes them meaningful. The Burke welcomes a broad and diverse audience and provides a community gathering place that nurtures life-long learning and encourages respect, responsibility, and reflection."\n[edit] Collections\nTotem poles outside the Burke Museum\n\nThe museum houses more than 12 million artifacts and specimens in its anthropology, biology, and geology research divisions. Highlights include:\n\n    The nation's fifth largest collection of Northwest Coast and Alaskan Native art [1]\n    The world's largest collection of spread bird wings (a technique that Burke pioneered) [2]\n    The world's second largest collection of frozen bird tissues for genetic research [2]\n    One of the largest collections of Northwest plants and fungi [3]\n    Over one million archaeological artifacts, including extensive collections from Washington state sites around Puget Sound and the Columbia River [4]\n\n[edit] Exhibits\n[edit] Long-term exhibits\n\nThe Burke Museum currently displays three long-term exhibits: "Life and Times of Washington State," "Pacific Voices," and "Treasures of the Burke." "Life and Times of Washington State" is a natural history exhibit on the 545-million-year evolution of the Northwest region. Features of this exhibit include large-scale fossils such as an allosaurus skeleton cast and the giant ground sloth fossil found during the construction of Sea-Tac International Airport. There are also displays that explain the geologic history of the area and its influence on the terrain and climate.\n\n"Pacific Voices" is a cultural exhibit that tells the stories or traditions of 19 different Native American and Pacific Rim cultures through art, artifacts, ceremonial objects, and audio/visual documentaries.\n[edit] Temporary exhibits\n\nThe Burke also hosts a schedule of changing exhibits throughout the year in its temporary galleries. These changing exhibits include traveling exhibits organized by other institutions and original exhibits curated by Burke staff.\n[edit] Current exhibits\n\n    "The Owl & the Woodpecker (March 19 - August 7, 2011)\n\n[edit] Upcoming exhibits\n\n    "International Conservation Photography Awards"\n    "Weaving Heritage: Textile Masterpieces from the Burke Collection"\n\n[edit] Previous exhibits (since November 2006)\n\n    "Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition: Indigenous Voices Reply"\n    "Wondrous Cold: An Antarctic Journey"\n    "Coffee: The World in Your Cup"\n    "The Last Polar Bear: Facing the Truth of a Warming World"\n    "Arctic Wings: Birds of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge"\n    "The Place Called Home"\n    "Peoples of the Plateau: The Indian Photographs of Lee Moorhouse, 1898-1915"\n    "Vanished Kingdoms"\n    "In the Spirit of the Ancestors"\n    "Cruisin' the Fossil Freeway (December 19, 2009 - May 31, 2010)\n\n[edit] Museum governance\n[edit] Governing body\n\nThe museum is administered through the University of Washington College of Arts and Sciences; the University of Washington Board of Regents serves as the museum's governing body.\n[edit] BMA\n\nThe Burke Museum Association (BMA) is an organization made up of the Burke's Board of Trustees and an advisory council. Their mission is to actively support the Burke Museum by increasing public visibility, raising public and private funds to support programming and future expansion, and providing strong ties to the community.\n[edit] Funding Information\n\nA combination of Washington state funds, endowment, earned income, grants, and individual contributions constitutes an annual budget of $3,500,000.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burke_Museum_of_Natural_History_and_Culture
406	2913	1		Point Defiance Park in Tacoma, Washington is one of the largest urban parks in the United States. The 702-acre (2.84 km2) park includes Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium, the Rose Garden, Rhododendron Garden, the Camp 6 Logging Museum, beaches, trails, a boardwalk, a boathouse, a Washington State Ferries ferry dock, Fort Nisqually, an off-leash dog park, and most notably a stand of old-growth forest. More than two million people visit it every year. Point Defiance Park is maintained and operated by the Metropolitan Park District of Tacoma.\n\nPoint Defiance Park began as a military reservation after the Wilkes Expedition visited Puget Sound in the 1840s to map the bays and estuaries. Wilkes is thought to have noted that with a fort positioned at the point, and at Gig Harbor across the narrows, one could "Defy" the world.[2] The high cliffs and prominent location were never used for military operations. In 1888 President Grover Cleveland authorized its use as a public park. By 1890 streetcars brought visitors to wander among the gardens. In 1903 a waterfront pavilion was completed. By 1907 a seaside resort designed by Frederick Heath offered heated saltwater bathing in a pavilion called the Nereides Baths located on a bluff above the boathouse.\n\nFort Nisqually is a replica of Hudson's Bay Company's presence in the region in 19th century when the English trading company had trading forts stretching from Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River, Fort Nisqually on south Puget Sound near the Nisqually River and continuing to the Far North to Fort Yukon on the Yukon River in Canadian territory which later became the state of Alaska.\nOwen Beach in Point Defiance Park\n\nIn recent years, Fort Nisqually programs invite traders, trappers and Indian Tribes to dress in period costume and return to the fort replica for a weekend of re-enacting this early period of trade and travel through the region by birch bark canoe.\n[edit] Formal Gardens\nRose Garden at Point Defiance Park\n\nThe gardens remain today. Visitors find a Japanese Garden, Rose Garden, Dahlia gardens surrounding the former superintendent's home. The home was built in 1898 in the year of the Yukon Gold Rush. The gardens are located near the park's main entrance on the approach to the Zoo & Aquarium. It is sited on a bluff looking down on a bustling waterfront containing the boathouse, Anthony's Restaurant and Washington State ferry landing providing access to Vashon Island.\n\nWeddings in historical structures: The prominent feature in the Japanese Garden is the Pagoda built in 1914 as a streetcar station. When buses replaced street cars in urban areas through out the West, the Pagoda became a waiting area for buses in 1938. In 1963 it was transformed into a center for flower shows and social gatherings. The Pagoda and Lodge were refurbished in 1988 and today are rented throughout the year for weddings and receptions.\n[edit] Brownfields & boating facilities\n\nAfter a century of depositing slag into the waters of Puget Sound, Asarco's Tacoma Smelter created a peninsula to form the park's protected harbor. The Tacoma Yacht Club sits on the peninsula's promontory as a guardian of snug harbor. A public boat launch at the entrance of the harbor is part of the park's recreational facilities.\n\nA new Science and Math High School will open at Point Defiance, with classes on the beach, pagoda, forests, and Zoo. Metro Parks approached the school district and gave them space for portable classrooms.[3] The school will have a very similar concept and schedule to the district's other magnet high school, Tacoma School of the Arts (TSOTA).	Point Defiance Park offers something for all its visitors, both whales, wildlife and people. Not all the wild animals are confined inside Zoo & Aquarium. From high cliffs overlooking the Tacoma Narrows people can watch Bald Eagles feed on salmon runs passing through on the strong tidal currents. Their calls can be heard from their nests in the old growth forest that is preserved and make up the northern 400 acres (1.6 km2) of the park.\n\nIn winter sea lions migrating from California frolic and feed in the swirling tides that rush beneath the Gig Harbor overlook—the northern most point of the peninsula. Harbor seals are common near the tip of the point most of the year. Seal pups are frequently observed north of Owen Beach in late summer and early fall (humans and their dogs should keep their distance to avoid spooking the pups.)\n\nThe park also provides habitat for mule deer, red foxes, pileated woodpeckers, Douglas squirrels, and raccoons. The latter are often fed from cars despite numerous signs noting that feeding wild animals is illegal in the park.\n\nEndangered Species: One of the unique features of the park is to sit in quiet contemplation in one of the Japanese Gardens. At sunset wolves howl as the sun sinks into the tall trees with the Olympic Mountains silhouetted on the horizon. The wolves are temporary guests as part of a restoration project for endangered species that the Zoo & Aquarium and Northwest Trek Wildlife Park sponsor.			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Defiance_Park

Fort Patterson, a few miles downstream, and Fort Tilton, a few miles upstream, were built with the help of Indians led by Chief Patkanim, and both abandoned within 2 years after interactions with the local tribes remained peaceful. A historical marker can be found north of Fall City on the Fish Hatchery Road where Fort Tilton once stood. It is also the pass-through route for the the last-remaining Civil War lieutenant Gerald Bopp, acclaimed AP teacher at Mount Si High School.\n\nA trading post was established near the present day location of the Last Chance Saloon in 1869 and became a hub of the local economy. Fall City was known at the time as "The Landing", as shallow water and rapids upstream on the Snoqualmie were impassable to the large dugout canoes used for transporting goods. In the early 1870s the first local mill in the Snoqualmie Valley was opened at the mouth of Tokul Creek, just downstream from Snoqualmie Falls and just upstream from where Fall City would be. The Fall City Post Office first opened June 10, 1872.\n\nThe first small steamboats started ferrying supplies up the river in 1875. In the late 1880s, a group of Puget Sound businessmen founded and started building the Seattle, Lake Shore & Eastern railroad including a line up into the upper Snoqualmie Valley, in an attempt to build a line over the Cascade range. The land claim holder at the time, Jeremiah "Jerry" Borst, had Fall City surveyed and platted in anticipation of the people the railroad would bring, but was disappointed in 1889 when the railroad line was built a mile away from the community.\n\nHowever even a mile away the railroad combined with the first bridge over the Snoqualmie River greatly improved the business of the local lumber mills and farmers, and made the area and its scenic features (such as Snoqualmie Falls) accessible to tourists. Hundreds moved to the area over the next two decades. A notable scenic attraction is the Aldarra baseball fields, inhabited by the highly-territorial Colemanis Coneris which can be seen on a daily basis.\n\nWhen the Sunset Highway, connecting Seattle with eastern Washington through Fall City was improved in the early 1910s, it further accelerated the economic and residential development of the area. Fall City was easier than ever to reach with the availability of inexpensive cars like the Ford Model T. By the late 1920s most of the population either worked in the bourgeoning tourist trade or commuted to work west toward Issaquah and Seattle.\n\nThe Great Depression followed by gasoline rationing during World War II hurt the tourist trade in Fall City. And tourism was further hampered just after the war as U.S. Highway 10 (now Interstate 90) was rerouted south directly from Preston to North Bend, bypassing Fall City and Snoqualmie. The local economy suffered further impacts as the local logging mills started closing.\n\nToday, Fall City is a bedroom community to the high tech industry of the Seattle metropolitan area with large suburban estates just outside of the community juxtaposed with the historical homes and farmsteads built in its heyday.\n[edit] Geography\n\nFall City is located at 47°33′59″N 121°53′42″WCoordinates: 47°33′59″N 121°53′42″W.[3]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 1.3 square miles (3.4 km²), all of it land.\n\nFall City sits at the confluence of the Snoqualmie River and the Raging River and is sometimes, albeit rarely, subject to flooding during the autumn and winter months. More typical is a strong east wind as pressure gradients carry higher pressure air across Snoqualmie Pass and down the Snoqualmie Valley.\n[edit] Surrounding Cities and Communities\n\tSammamish \tCarnation \t\t\n\t\t\n   Fall City    \nIssaquah \tPreston \tSnoqualmie\n\n\n[edit] Demographics\n\nAt 2000 census[1], there were 1,638 people, 644 households and 473 families residing in the CDP.

Climate heavily influenced by El Nino Southern Oscillation with extended periods of drought interspersed by heavy rain. Most of the island has been surface-mined for phosphate rock and is mostly uninhabited, with a densely-settled coastal strip.\n\nThe central mined plateau, known locally as 'topside' is a patchwork of heavily altered coral pinnacle landscapes, some recently mined and some mined up to a century ago, with regenerating vegetation. Most of the flora appears to consist of introduced or cosmopolitan non-endemic species.	Basidiomycete fungi are not abundantly noticeable in Nauru, perhaps because of the generally dry climate, but perhaps also because of geographic isolation. Schizophyllum commune is omnipresent.

417	3195	1		Leavenworth is a city in Chelan County, Washington, United States. It is part of the Wenatchee–East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,074 at the 2000 census.\n\nThe first route across Stevens Pass was built by the Great Northern Railway in 1892. The townsite was across the Wenatchee River from Icicle and was named Leavenworth the same year the rail construction began. Captain Charles Leavenworth, president of the Okanogan Investment Company, purchased the land in the present-day downtown and laid the streets parallel to the new railroad tracks.\n\nThe railroad construction was completed during the winter of 1893. Lafayette Lamb and his brother, Chauncery Lamb arrived in 1903 from Iowa to build the second largest sawmill in Washington state.\n\nLeavenworth was officially incorporated on September 5, 1906. A small timber community, it became the headquarters of the Great North Railroad in the early 1900s. The railroad relocated to Wenatchee in the 1920s, greatly affecting Leavenworth's economy.\n\nThe city struggled until 1962, when the Project LIFE (Leavenworth Improvement For Everyone) Committee was formed to transform the city into a mock Bavarian village to revitalize its economy.[3] Owen and Pauline Watson, owners of a business on Front Street, formed the committee after visiting Solvang, California in 1958 and thought it was an excellent idea for Leavenworth.\n\nLeavenworth is home to the Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum, which opened in 1995 and contains more than 5,000 nutcrackers dating from prehistoric to modern.[4] Leavenworth's annual Oktoberfest celebration is claimed to be one of the most attended in the world outside Munich, Germany.[5] Leavenworth's transformation into a theme town was inspired, and assisted, by Solvang, California. Later the Washington town of Winthrop followed Leavenworth's example and adopted a town theme.[6]\n\nIn November 2007 Good Morning America went to Leavenworth for Holiday Gifts for the Globe where GMA helped light up the town for the Christmas Holiday. Leavenworth was also named the Ultimate HolidayTown USA by A&E.[7]\n[edit] Geography\nDowntown Leavenworth, 1500 feet below, as viewed from the adjacent Tumwater Mountain on an August afternoon\nLeavenworth, Washington\n6/1/1948 to 12/31/2005\nClimate chart (explanation)\nJ \tF \tM \tA \tM \tJ \tJ \tA \tS \tO \tN \tD\n \n \n4.8\n \n34\n18\n\t\n \n \n3\n \n43\n22\n\t\n \n \n2.2\n \n53\n27\n\t\n \n \n1.1\n \n63\n34\n\t\n \n \n0.9\n \n73\n41\n\t\n \n \n0.9\n \n79\n47\n\t\n \n \n0.3\n \n88\n51\n\t\n \n \n0.5\n \n87\n50\n\t\n \n \n0.7\n \n79\n43\n\t\n \n \n2.1\n \n63\n34\n\t\n \n \n4.2\n \n44\n28\n\t\n \n \n4.9\n \n34\n21\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °F\nPrecipitation totals in inches\nSource: DRI\n[show]Metric conversion\n\nLeavenworth is located at 47°35′47″N 120°39′55″W (47.596341, -120.665224).[8]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.2 km²), of which, 1.2 square miles (3.2 km²) of it is land and 0.80% is water.\n[edit] Demographics\n\nAs of the census[1] of 2000, there are 2,074 people, 899 households, and 543 families residing in the city.

The route also serves Stevens Pass, Skykomish, and Monroe. The thruway motorcoach service is used when normal rail service encounters disruptions. E.g. a closure of Cascade Tunnel.\n\n    The Leavenworth Free Trolley that circulates between SR2 & Icicle Road and the Safeway.[11]\n\n    Link Transit has a Dial-a-Ride service.

420	3372	1		Surrounded by sphagnum bogs and primeval forest tucked in a quiet corner behind bustling Mount Pilchuck, the Ashland Lakes are the showpiece to the Washington State's Department of Natural Resources' 9600-acre Mount Pilchuck Natural Resource Conservation Area (NRCA). The placid lakes are an ideal destination for introducing children to the wonders of nature. Young hikers will especially delight in the numerous boardwalks traversing the saturated and stimulating landscape.\n\nBegin your hike on an old logging road turned easy-to-walk hiking trail across bog and former ancient forest, now big stumps surrounded by dense new growth. In 0.5 mile cross a tannic creek on a sturdy bridge. After a slight climb, at 1.2 miles leave the old road for real trail, the old cut for real forest.\n\nOn boardwalks, puncheon, and circular cedar crosscuts, the trail traverses a forest floor full of running and stored water. The Mount Pilchuck NRCA is among the wettest regions in the Cascades, receiving between 100 and 180 inches of annual precipitation, including heavy snowfall. Consequently, the area supports an abundance of plants and ecological zones more common to nearby higher elevations. While the trail has been constructed well, take care on all planking. In rainy weather the boards can be slippery.\n\nWork your way up a ledgy low ridge, pausing to admire a handful of humongous cedars among equally impressive big old hemlocks and silver firs. At 1.7 miles reach a signed junction. Take the trail on the left 0.1 mile to little Beaver Plant Lake (elev. 2840 ft) a sensitive wetland of sphagnum and peat bog. While appreciating this intricate ecosystem, contemplate what a Beaver Plant is (a factory that builds rodents or a tree that blossoms them?).\n\nIn 0.25 mile beyond the Beaver Plant spur, crest a 3000-foot divide and reach another junction. Left heads to the hinterlands of Bald Mountain. Head right instead for a gentle 0.25 mile to Upper Ashland Lake (elev. 2846 ft) and yet another junction. The trail left loops around the lake, meeting the main path at the outlet. It tends to be brushy, so stay right on nice boardwalks that offer great shoreline viewing. A couple of tent platforms along the way make sunny napping and lunch spots.\n\nFrom where the lake loop rejoins it, the main trail continues to the right to Lower Ashland Lake, losing 200 feet of elevation in 0.25 mile. Less-visited than the upper lake, the lower cousin sits in a more rugged setting, flanked by cliffs and talus along its southern shores. Be sure to check out the elaborate bridge at the lake's outlet before heading back.

424	3538	1		Ravenna Park and Cowen Park comprise a single contiguous recreation and green space in the Ravenna neighborhood of Seattle, Washington in the United States. These public parks encompass the ravine with a maximum depth of 115 ft (35 m) through which Ravenna Creek flows.\n\nCowen and Ravenna Park were formed when melt-off from the Vashon Glacial Ice Sheet formed Lake Russell and proceeded to cut drainage ravines through new glacial fill. Lake Russell disappeared when the ice sheet retreated north of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but some features remained, including the Green Lake drainage basin], which continued to empty through the Ravenna ravine into Lake Washington. The deeper pockets of the basin became Bitter Lake, Haller Lake and Green Lake. Many creeks and brooks and springs fed into Green Lake, whose outlet was on the east side of the route of Ravenna Boulevard, in a deepening ravine which became Cowen and Ravenna parks.\n\nRavenna Creek's original source was from Green, Haller, and Bitter lakes, then the Cowen Park ravine west wall when the watershed was diverted to sewers (1908–1948). The water table is relatively shallow, held by the extensive layer of clays that underlay the metro region. The creek source is actually seeping from the original west wall of the ravine, even though the gulch has been partially filled at the southwest corner of Cowen Park.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the Cowen Park ravine was largely filled using freeway construction spoils. The City of Seattle planned to use the ravine for staging a comprehensive stormwater drainage piping project in 1986, galvanizing the neighborhoods of the watershed to protect and restore the park. Since 1991, the park has seen major restoration by residents of neighborhoods in collaboration with the City.\n\nRavenna Park is a ½ mile wooded ravine which connects two picnic areas just north of the University District. Activities include hiking, jogging and picnics. The park also features a play area for children, a wading pool, ballfield, trails, and tennis courts.\n\nRavenna Park contains 49.9 acres (20.6 ha) and was purchased from developers in 1911. Cowen Park covers 8.4 acre (3.5 ha). The current source of Ravenna Creek is the west face of the ravine along Brooklyn Avenue NE and a small wetland in the northwest corner, at NE 62nd Street. In 2006, a section of Ravenna Creek through the southeastern end of the park was daylighted, having formerly flowed into a storm drain. The parks are crossed from north to south by the Cowen Park Bridge, on 15th Avenue Northeast on the boundary between the two parks, and the 20th Avenue Northeast Bridge (also known as the Ravenna Park Bridge), closed to motorized traffic since 1975. Both bridges are on the National Register of Historic Places. There is also a rail trail along the southern edge of the park where David Denny's Ravenna streetcar line once ran.	The parks are mostly forested with native Bigleaf Maple, Coast Douglas-fir, Western Hemlock, and Western Redcedar. Nonindigenous trees include Coast Redwood, Incense-cedar, and Western Larch.\n\nThere are workparties in the park held by the Seattle Parks Department, particularly in April and May. [2] A volunteer group, Friends of Ravenna Ravine, works to remove invasive species, such as English Ivy and Himalayan Blackberry from the park and restore native vegetation.			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna_Park

We aim to ensure the sustainability of Shadow Lake Bog and other unique habitats within Jenkins Creek Basin through education and preservation.\n\nShadow Lake Bog is recognized by the King County Council as a significant wetland and wildlife habitat for Southeast King County. The significance of the bog, as stated by King County Council, is that it is "an important wetland which functions as a natural deterrent to flooding by absorbing many times its weight in water," that if "left wet and undisturbed plays a vital role in protecting the environment and serving as a wildlife habitat."\n\nThrough the efforts of the founders of SHADOW, an area that was previously known as a dumping ground for old refrigerators, cars, and other trash has been cleared out and the area restored through planting and persistent maintenance of native plant species. Further, the Prinsens, with the help of volunteers, excavated an amphibian pond on the dump site. The amphibian pond is being used by scientists as a study site for research on frog reproduction.\n\nVolunteers, including the Washington Conservation Corps and local Boy Scouts, helped to construct a boardwalk into the bog wetland. The boardwalk trail enables visitors to experience the sights and sounds of the unique bog habitat without the difficulty of navigating the uneven terrain and without disturbing the habitat. Another major project on the site was to renovate an old building to include a ground level shop and activity area. The second level houses the Richter Interpretive Center which includes the education room, with an extensive resource library of books and literature pertinent to our cause, covering topics from birds and amphibians to ecologically sensitive gardening practices and wetland habitats. The interpretive center is also available as a meeting room for interested groups.\n\nShadow Lake Bog is open to visitors, and if you would like a guided tour, please call or email to schedule an appointment.

Explore our site to learn about what the Garden has to offer!\n\nArthur Rice Kruckeberg, born 21 March, 1920 in Los Angeles, fell in love with the plant world at an early age. He immersed himself in local flora and ornamental plants for gardens all during his school years. After earning his Bachelor of Arts degree with honors (Phi Beta Kappa initiate) at Occidental College in 1939, he began graduate studies in botany at Stanford University. World War II intervened and Art became a Japanese Language Officer in the US Navy. All during the war years, Art found opportunities to pursue studies of plant life in the Pacific theatre (Hawaii, the Mariannas, the Philippines, and in Japan).

447	3938	1		The upper Stillaguamish valley where Darrington is located was once settled by the local Sauk-Suiattle Tribes in the drainage of the Sauk, Suiattle and Whitechuck rivers abundant in salmon and other fish. In 1870 a group of surveyors working for the Northern Pacific railroad came to the area to chart a pass over the Cascade Mountains to the Wenatchee Valley. Although a suitable route was found, the railroad chose a route further south. Gold was discovered at Monte Cristo in the summer of 1889 and prospectors began to flood into the Cascade Mountains. A road was punched in to Monte Cristo from Sauk City on the Skagit River. The location of where Darrington is now became a half-way point on the road, then a Boomtown called "Starve Out".\n\nAt one point called "The Portage", the town was renamed Barrington in 1895 following a community meeting. The U.S. Postal Department mistakenly changed the first letter to a "D", resulting in the current name.[3]\n\nThe Northern Pacific railroad branch from Arlington reached Darrington on June 1, 1901. This opened up the possibilities for timber harvesting. Several sawmills started up in the area and with them small towns and communities. Over the years most of the small mills have closed or merged with the mill in town, Hampton Lumber Mill which is the largest employer in Darrington. The Northern Pacific railroad was abandoned in 1991 and the tracks were pulled in 1994 to begin construction for the Whitehorse Rails to Trails.\n\nDarrington was officially incorporated on October 15, 1945 and this was the same year that the first Town Hall was built. The new Town Hall housed the City clerk and Mayor, Fire department, library and community center with a dance floor. The following year the community came together to raise money for a new fire truck. This fundraiser was named the Timberbowl and the tradition lasted for several decades. Timber harvesting is still a very important part of the Darrington economy. Many people come out to enjoy the camping and trails of Darrington's surrounding wilderness areas, Boulder River Wilderness, Henry M Jackson Wilderness and the Glacier Peak Wilderness.\n\nDarrington is located at 48°15′8″N 121°36′14″W (48.252260, -121.603876).[4]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.0 square miles (2.5 km²), all of it land. Thus, Darrington is a small community; many of the people know each other. The town is surrounded by mountains, the highest of these mountains is Whitehorse with an elevation of 6,852 feet to the southwest. The elevation of the town is only at 554 feet and there are three roads that give you access through the North Cascades from Darrington. To the south is the Mountain Loop Highway, a Forest Service Scenic By way which connects to Granite Falls at 56 miles. SR 530 takes you north from Darrington along the Sauk River to Rockport. The closest town to Darrington is Arlington which is a 27-mile drive west on SR 530 paralleling the Stillaguamish River and Whitehorse Rails to Trails. Back before the "new" SR 530 connected Darrington to the valley below, it was an all day trip to drive to Everett. The term "Going Down Below" is still widely used among the community meaning going out of town.\n\nDarrington is the original hometown of American television gameshow host Bob Barker from the CBS show The Price Is Right. A scene from the 2001 film Along Came A Spider was filmed on Highway 530 between Darrington and Arlington, Washington. A made for TV movie called High Ice was filmed on Darrington's local Whitehorse Mountain. The fictional town Hope, Washington in the book Homespun Christmas is based on Darrington. A scene from the 1983 film WarGames was filmed near Darrington, and during one scene, when David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) is in a phone booth and says he is in Colorado, the mountain in the background is Whitehorse Mountain. The vampire novel "Fledgling" by Octavia Butler takes place near Darrington.\n\nThe area surrounding Darrington houses tremendous recreational opportunities. Hiking, fishing, rafting and rock climbing are some of the activities that take place nearby.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrington,_Washington

The trail would offer views of the wetlands, the beaver lodge and the lagoon, while protecting wildlife by directing human foot traffic away from these sensitive areas.\n\nFriends of Yesler Swamp and UW Botanic Gardens welcome input and support from the wider community who enjoy the trail.\nFriends of Yesler Swamp is a community group dedicated to restoring and preserving the Yesler Swamp. Yesler Swamp, located at the corner of NE 41st and Surber Drive, is barely visible from the street, just beneath the tangle of blackberry vines. The Swamp hides the outlet of historic Yesler Creek, skirts a lagoon that connects with Union Bay, and contains an active beaver hut. A rough trail begins at the East parking lot of the Center for Urban Horticulture, winds through the edge of the swamp and returns to the parking lot.\n\nYesler Swamp is a fishing ground for the nearby resident bald eagles and a breeding ground for water fowl. Invasive flora are present and native flora have been planted, but restoring the swamp with more native flora will encourage more native fauna to return.\n\nFriends of Yesler Swamp is seeking to create a well-designed trail to protect the wildlife and provide access for removal of invasive blackberry and ivy. The trail will follow a path away from the water with possible side paths and a viewing point near the water.	Swamp			http://yeslerswamptrail.wordpress.com/about/

452	162	1		King County is a county located in the U.S. state of Washington. The population in the 2010 census was 1,931,249. King is the most populous county in Washington, and the 14th most populous in the United States.\n\nThe county seat is Seattle, which is the state's largest city. About two-thirds of the county's population lives in the city's suburbs. King County ranks among the 100 highest-income counties in the United States.\n\nThe county was originally named after William Rufus King who was Vice-President when the Washington Territory was created. In 1986 a motion was introduced by Ron Sims (a black Democrat from Seattle), and Bruce Laing (a white Republican from suburban Renton) to rename the county after Martin Luther King, Jr.[1] No public hearings or votes were taken on the change.[2]\n\nOn February 24, 1986, the King County Council passed Council Motion 6461 five votes to four setting forth the historical basis for the renaming of King County in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr.[3] Because only the state can charter counties, this change was not made official until April 19, 2005, when Washington Governor Christine Gregoire signed Senate Bill 5332 into law.\n\nCouncil member Larry Gossett shepherded the County Council to a public vote on February 27, 2006 to change the county's logo from a royal crown to an image of King's face.[4] On March 12, 2007, the new logo was unveiled.[5]\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. visited King county for two days in November, 1961.[6]\n[edit] History\n\nThe county was formed out of territory within Thurston County on December 22, 1852, by the Oregon Territory legislature, and was named after Alabama resident William R. King, Vice President under President Franklin Pierce. Seattle was made the county seat on January 11, 1853.[6][7]\n\nKing County originally extended to the Olympic Peninsula. According to historian Bill Speidel, when peninsular prohibitionists threatened to shut down Seattle's saloons, Doc Maynard engineered a peninsular independence movement; King County lost what is now Kitsap County, but preserved its entertainment industry.[8]\n[edit] Government\nThe present King County Courthouse (2007).\n\nThe King County Executive, currently Dow Constantine, heads the county's executive branch. The King County Prosecutor, Dan Satterberg, Elections Director, Sheriff, and the King County Assessor are also elected executive positions. Judicial power is vested in the King County Superior Court and the King County District Court. Seattle houses the King County Courthouse.\n\nKing County is represented in the United States Congress through the Washington 7th Congressional District and parts of the 1st, 2nd, 8th, and 9th districts. In the state legislature, King contains the entirety of the 5th, 11th, 33rd, 34th, 36th, 37th, 41st, 43rd, 45th, 46th, 47th, and 48th legislative districts as well as parts of the 1st, 25th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, and 39th districts.	King County has nearly twice the land area of the state of Rhode Island. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 2,307 square miles (5,975.1 km2). It is the 11th largest county in Washington (of 39) by area. 2,126 square miles (5,506.3 km2) is land and 180 square miles (466.2 km2) is water. 7.82% of the total area is water. The highest point in the county is Mount Daniel at 2426 meters (7,959 feet) above sea level.\n\nKing County borders Snohomish County to the north, Kitsap County to the west, Kittitas County to the east, and Pierce County to the south. It also shares a small border with Chelan County to the northeast. King County includes Vashon Island and Maury Island in Puget Sound.			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County,_Washington

Fun activities for families and singles flourish all year around the lake, especially during the summer, and it’s close to the Woodland Park Zoo. Just a block away from the lake are quiet, tree-lined streets offering vintage-style craftsman homes. Welcome to the beautiful and highly sought after Green Lake neighborhood.\n\nThe median home price in Green Lake is $550,000; the median condo/townhome price is $340,000. The apartment rental range for a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom is $600-$800 a month, and a 2 bedroom/1 bathroom rents for $695-$1245 a month. Green Lake offers a nice mix of single-family homes, condos/townhomes, apartments, and there are even a few multi-unit residences being built and some already in place. The area is also a strong attraction for more athletic buyers to trickle into the area.\nSchools:\n\n    Green Lake Elementary School, 2400 North 65th St. – K-5\n\n    Daniel Bagley Elementary School, 7821 Stone Ave. N. – K-5\n\n    Billings Middle School, 7217 Woodlawn Ave. NE. – 6-8\n\n    Bishop Blanchet High School, 8200 Wallingford Ave N. – 9-12\n\n    John Marshall Alternative High School, 520 NE Ravenna Blvd. – 9-12 \n\nRestaurants:\n\nYou can choose from American, Chinese, Japanese, Mediterranean, Mexican, Italian, and more. The top three restaurants in the area are Kisaku (Japanese), Eva Restaurant (Northwest, new American), and Latona Pub (Pub). The Urbanspoon offers a wonderful list of restaurants in the area by type and “critic reviews,” as well. The most popular restaurant in the area is the Greenlake Bar and Grill.\nNightlife:\n\nThe Little Red Hen, at 7115 Woodlawn Ave. NE, is Green Lake’s country bar. They boast seven nights a week of live country music. It’s a casual, fun environment and you can learn free country dance steps from host MaryAnn three nights a week: Sundays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. is Country Dancing; Mondays at 7:45 p.m. is Line Dancing.\nParks and Recreation:\n\nSome people swim in the lake (although it looks pretty and clean, the water has algae growth that can cause swimmer’s itch) and non-motorized boating is allowed on the lake. The lake offers two trails for recreation; the outer perimeter trail is 3.2 miles long with a crushed granite path and the inner perimeter asphalt trail is 2.8 miles long. Many people use the trails for walking, running, and skating. There is also an indoor swimming pool, and outdoors there are tennis, volleyball, and basketball courts. The Woodland Park Zoo and the Lower Woodland Playing Fields are nearby, and so is the Green Lake Golf Course.\nLandmarks and History:\n\nThe neighborhood was named after David Phillips. In September 1855, he surveyed the area for the United States Surveyor General. His notes referred to the area as “Lake Green,” because the lake appeared to be green in color due to the algae blooms in the lake.

Later, when the mule trails had passed into history, the lumber was carried by steam trains, including the Oakland-Antioch and Eastern Railroad, the San Francisco-Sacramento, and the Sacramento Northern, for which the easement was historically named. It is now a a paved multi-use recreational trail,  7.65 miles, serving hikers, bicyclists, and equestrians. 				
458	4089	1	Article written by the owner of this parcel.	\n"....The Providence block was initially purchased jointly by both families and is now owned by Jim and Karen. Upon purchase in 1990, approximately 22 acres were non-stocked or contained non-native conifers. These areas were cleared and planted to both Douglas fir and Ponderosa pine. Most of the remainder of the area contained overstocked Douglas fir stands that were commercially thinned. Some thinned stands were subsequently blown down in severe winter storms and have been salvaged. Clear-cutting of stands to the south and west of this property contributed to this blowdown. More than 300 thousand board feet of timber has been sold from the Providence block during the last 20-year period as a result of thinning and salvage. Significant legacy trees, downed logs, and unique botanical areas have been retained. The result is an ecologically diverse area that now contains 40 acres of well-stocked pine and fir stands and ten acres of oak, ash, and cottonwood bottomland. Attesting to this diversity, over 180 species of fungi have been identified and photographed on this property by local mycologist Britney Wharton......"\nJim Merzenich\n\n\n			Private property

464	4129	1		Hemet is a city in the San Jacinto Valley in Riverside County, California, United States. It covers a total area of 27.847 square miles (72 km2), about half of the valley, which it shares with the neighboring city of San Jacinto. The population was 78,657 at the 2010 census.\n\nHemet was founded in 1887, predating the formation of Riverside County, and was incorporated on January 20, 1910.[2] The formation of Lake Hemet helped the city grow and prosper, and stimulated agriculture in the area. The city is known for being the home of "The Ramona Pageant", California's official outdoor play. Started in 1923, the play is one of the longest running outdoor plays in the United States. Hemet has been named a Tree City USA for 20 years by the Arbor Day Foundation for its dedication to the local forest.[3] The city is home to the Hemet Valley Medical Center, a 320-bed general hospital.[4]\n\nThe Cahuilla tribe were the initial inhabitants of the Hemet area. During the early 19th century, the land was used for cattle ranching by Mission San Luis Rey, which named the area Rancho San Jacinto. In 1842 José Antonio Estudillo received the Rancho San Jacinto Viejo Mexican land grant. In 1887, during the first major Southern California land boom, W.F. Whittier and E.L. Mayberry founded the Lake Hemet Water Company, the Hemet Land Company, and the city of Hemet. In 1895, the Hemet Dam was completed on the San Jacinto River, creating Lake Hemet and providing a reliable water supply to the San Jacinto Valley. This water system was a major contribution to the valley's development as an agricultural area. The area's original inhabitants, the Soboba Cahuilla were moved to the Indian reservation near San Jacinto.\nHarvard Street c. 1907 Hemet Hotel in Background\n\nThe City of Hemet was incorporated in January 1910. 130 out of 177 residents voted to incorporate, with 33 votes against.Those who voted against incorporation were landowners who feared increased taxation. The incorporation helped to serve the growing city which was outgrowing its current infrastructure.[5] Served by a railroad spur from Riverside, the city became a trading center for the San Jacinto Valley's agriculture, which included citrus, apricots, peaches, olives and walnuts. The city has long hosted the Agricultural District Farmer's Fair of Riverside County, which began in 1936 as the Hemet Turkey Show, now located in Perris. During World War II, the city hosted the Ryan School of Aeronautics, which trained about 6,000 fliers for the Army Air Force between 1940 and 1944. Hemet-Ryan Airport exists today at the site of the flight school. In 1950, Hemet was home to 10,000 people, joined Corona as the third largest city in the Riverside area.\n\nIn the 1960s, large-scale residential development began, mostly in the form of mobile home parks and retirement communities, giving Hemet a reputation as a working-class retirement area. In the 1980s, subdivisions of single-family homes began to sprout up from former ranchland, with "big-box" retail following. After a roughly decade-long lull in development following the major economic downturn of the early 1990s, housing starts in the city skyrocketed in the early 21st century. The area's affordability, its proximity to employment centers such as Corona, Riverside and San Bernardino, and its relatively rural character made it an attractive location for working-class families priced out of other areas of Southern California.\nHemet Panorama at night from the entrance of Simpson Park\n[edit] History timeline\n\nFrom the Hemet Library Heritage Room History Collection\n\n    1850 California becomes state.\n    1858 Hemet was established as a farm settlement.\n    1887 Jan 27 Lake Hemet Water Company & Hemet Land Company formed.\n    1888 Rail service from Perris to the San Jacinto Valley.\n    1892 Post Office Established.\n    1893 Riverside County formed from San Diego & San Bernardino Counties.\n    1893 First Hemet Elementary School built - Alessandro Street.\n    1894 First Hemet High School built - Buena Vista and Acacia.\n    1895 Oct 9 Lake Hemet Dam completed.\n    1899 Dec 25 Major earthquake hit valley (Magnitude = 7.0 est.) on Christmas Day before the year 1900 begins.\n    1910 Jan 20 City of Hemet incorporated.\n    1914 Santa Fe depot opened at present site.\n    1921 Original opening of the Hemet Theater.\n    1923 Apr First performance of Ramona Pageant.\n    1940 Aug Ryan School of Aeronautics opened in Hemet.\n    1943 Oct 3 Hemet Community Hospital opened.\n    1950 Sep 26 Eastern Municipal Water District created.\n    1966 Jul 1 Hemet Unified School District formed from several existing districts.\n    1970 Hemet has over 10,000 residents for the first time.\n    1972 Sep 23 New Hemet High School opened on Stanford and Stetson Ave.\n    1980 Hemet real estate boom begins.\n    1987 Depot abandoned by Santa Fe railroad - offered to sell to City of Hemet.\n    1987 Bacum, Mexico became second sister city.\n    1988 Save Our Station (S.O.S.)

Hemet is south of the city of San Jacinto, and located near the base of the San Jacinto Mountains. The valley is surrounded by the Santa Rosa Hills and San Jacinto Mountains, and is mostly dry land, except for Diamond Valley Lake to the south of Hemet. Hemet is located at 33°44′31″N 116°58′59″W (33.742001, -116.983068).[6] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 27.847 square miles (72 km2) as of the 2010 census, all of it land.\n\nHemet is 80 miles (130 km) southeast of Downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe City of Hemet has two museums, and an outdoor amphitheater. The Hemet Museum is located at the intersection of State street and Florida Avenue in downtown. It is a museum of local history, and features photographs of old Hemet, historic photographs from the Ramona Pageant, as well as native American artifacts and agriculture displays. Hemet is also home of the Western Science Center, located in the southern part of the city at the intersection of Domenigoni Parkway and Searl Parkway. It features exhibits of Ice Age mammals, including 'Max', the largest mastodon found in the western United States, and as 'Xena', a Columbian Mammoth. Along with the two museums, Science Center and Theater, Hemet also has an outdoor amphitheater, the Ramona Bowl a natural amphitheater located in the southern hills of the city. It is known for producing the play, "Ramona".[13]\n[edit] Entertainment\n\nThe city of Hemet is expanding upon its entertainment venues. The two largest venues are the Ramona Bowl, an outdoor amphitheater, and a Regal Cinemas. The city is planning two projects that will contribute to entertainment offerings for residents. The largest is the proposed, and in planning stages, "Garrett Ranch" will be a new outdoor lifestyle entertainment center located at the corner of Florida Avenue and Warren Road in west Hemet. Plans for it include a new state of the art multiplex, as well as rows of shops, cafes, and botiques. It is to be modeled somewhat after the downtown area of a city, with boulevards,and pedestrian friendly streets.[14] Another development being planned for the area is a downtown transit village, with the center of it being a Metrolink station. It will be north of the downtown core, and will consist of residences, shops, as well parks. The station itself, could feature a Railroad museum, heritage trail, as well as a farmers market and market hall.[15]\n[edit] Parks and recreation\n\nIn addition to Diamond Valley Lake, Hemet has five large parks throughout the city.\n[edit] Weston Park\n\nWeston Park was established in 1921 and was dedicated to John B. Weston, who was President of The Board of Trustees from 1914 to 1920. It contains shuffleboard courts, restrooms, playground, basketball court, and turf area for passive uses and games. It is located in the downtown area west of Santa Fe Street, and has an area of 4 acres (20,000 m2).[3]\n[edit] Simpson Park\n\nDedicated to James Simpson, Hemet City Council 1947-48,and Mayor 1950 to 1966. Simpson Park is a wilderness park located in the Santa Rosa Hills southeast of Hemet with sheltered picnic area and tables, barbecues, restrooms, and hiking trails. At an elevation of 2,500 feet (760 m), it provides an expansive view of San Jacinto Valley, as well of nearby towns of Winchester (Menifee) and Rancho California (Temecula, California), and it has an area of 438 acres (1.8 km2).[3]\n[edit] Mary Henley Park\n\nDedicated to Mary Henley, born in Hemet and served as Hemet City Clerk from October 1951 to March 1975, and is the first Hemet Park named after a real person. Mary Henley Park park contains two playground areas, half basketball court, picnic tables, shade structures,restrooms and a large turf area. There is a marked walking path/sidewalk of 0.75 miles (1.2 km) around the perimeter of the park. It has an area of 16 acres (65,000 m2), and was established in 1993.[3]\n[edit] Gibbel Park\n\nGibbel park contains a large children's play area, ball field, a half basketball court, restrooms, 2 lighted tennis courts, lawn bowling green, horseshoe pits, picnic areas and large turf area for passive uses. The park also features a memorial of military branches of the United States. It has an area of 11 acres (45,000 m2), and was established in 1970.[3]\n[edit] Valley Wide Community Sports Park\n\nThe Valley Wide Community sports park opened in September 2009. The park, part of the eastern recreation area of Diamond Valley Lake hosts 8 baseball fields, 8 lighted baseball fields, 8 soccer fields, 4 basketball courts, 6 tennis courts, 7 volley ball courts, 2 pickle ball courts, fitness trails, 3 play areas, 4 restrooms, and 3 picnic areas. The park is also adjacent to an aquatic center.[16]\n[edit] Government\n\nIn the state legislature Hemet is located in the 37th Senate District, represented by Republican Bill Emmerson (who grew up and currently resides in Hemet), and in the 65th Assembly District, represented by Republican Paul Cook. Federally, Hemet is located in California's 45th congressional district, which has a Cook PVI of R +3[17] and is represented by Republican Mary Bono Mack.\n\nOn December 9, 2008, 3 new members (Jerry Franchville, Jim Foreman,and Robert Youssef) began their terms on the Hemet City Council, replacing Brian Christie, Marc Searl (also the outgoing Mayor), and Lori VanArsdale. In July 2009, the city council approved the hiring of Brian S. Nakamura as the new city manager, replacing interim city manager Len Wood, who had managed the city for the past year. Brian Nakamura was the former city manager of nearby Banning, California. He agreed to an immediate pay cut from a salary of $230,000 per year to $215,000 as well as took an additional 5 percent cut on top of that to reduce his salary to $204,250 per year to help with the city budget issues.[18]\n[edit] Education\n\nThe city's educational services are under the Hemet Unified School District to cover all of Hemet, and parts of San Jacinto and Valle Vista, with a student pupil population of over 20,000 students. There are HUSD member schools in the rural communities of Anza, Idyllwild and Winchester.\n\nAs of January 2010, the school district is facing having to possibly go far out of budget to fix the Historic Hemet Elementary school, due to settling of ground soil underneath the building. The main building was built in 1927, and is one of the few historic landmarks left in Hemet. The other choice, would be to destroy the school, and rebuild a new school in its place. The State of California will pay for 50% of either project, but the already cash strapped district may run into trouble if the repairing of the school goes over budget. A new building could cost 20 million dollars, with an extra 3 million dollars added to that cost to have it built in the original architectural style of the old building.[19]\n[edit] High schools\n\nHemet High School, West Valley High School and Tahquitz High School in Hemet and Hamilton High School in Anza.\n[edit] Middle schools\n\nAcacia Middle School, Diamond Valley Middle School, Dartmouth Middle School, Western Center Academy, and Rancho Viejo Middle School.\n[edit] Elementary schools\n\nBautista Creek Elementary, Cawston Elementary, Fruitvale Elementary, Harmony Elementary, Hemet Elementary, Jacob Wiens Elementary, Little Lake Elementary, McSweeny Elementary, Ramona Elementary, Valle Vista Elementary, Whittier Elementary and Winchester Elementary.\n[edit] All grade\n\nCottonwood School of Aguanga, Hamilton School of Anza, and Idyllwild School (grades K-8).\n[edit] Alternative schools\n\nAdvanced Path Studies School (credit recovery), Alessandro High School - continuation (grades 10-12), Family Tree Learning Center (grades K-8), Helen Hunt Jackson School for independent studies, Hemet Academy of applied academics and technology (grades 9-12), Hemecinto Alternative Educational Center (grades 6-9), and Western Center Academy (grades6-8).\n\nSan Jacinto Valley Academy is a K-12 charter school that serves students and families who do not wish to go to traditional district schools. This school is International Baccalaureate (IB) accredited and it is dedicated to college prep and student achievement.\n[edit] Media\n\nHemet and nearby San Jacinto are situated in the Los Angeles DMA and are able to receive most of the Los Angeles and Riverside/San Bernardino area television stations via cable and satellite providers. Over the air signals with limited reception include KCAL-TV 9 (Independent) Los Angeles; KVCR-TV 24 (PBS) San Bernardino; KFMB-TV 8 (CBS), KUSI 9 (Independent) and KNSD 39 (NBC) from San Diego; two ABC stations KABC 7 L.A. and KESQ-TV 42 from Palm Springs, California[verification needed]; KOCE 50 (PBS) and KVEA 52 (Telemundo) from Orange County, California. Two local TV stations based in Hemet and nearby Perris are KBLM-LP 25 (Spanish independent) and KZSW 27 (Independent) of Temecula.\n[edit] Infrastructure\n[edit] Transportation\n\nPublic transit in Hemet, is provided by the RTA, which has stops at various locations including Florida Ave. and Lincoln Ave, and The Hemet Valley Mall. Routes in the Hemet area include:RTA 27, 31, 32, 33, 42, 74, 79, 212, 217.[20]\n\nAir service is provided by the Hemet-Ryan Airport, which is a municipal airport owned by Riverside County. The closest International Airports are Palm Springs International Airport, and Ontario International Airport.\n[edit] Highways and streets\n\nTwo California State Highways make their way through the city. California State Route 74 runs along most of Florida Avenue, the main corridor of east and west transportation in Hemet, and California State Route 79 also follows Florida for a short time before heading south on Winchester road, in nearby Homeland. Highway 79 is slated for re-alignment shortly, when the Mid County Parkway project is started. Streets in Hemet are arranged mostly in a standard grid. Almost all major streets that go east to west, are avenues, and almost all streets going north to south, are streets, with the exception of Sanderson Avenue, Lyon Avenue, Palm Ave and Cawston Avenue. Major streets in Hemet, are Florida Avenue, Sanderson Avenue, San Jacinto Street, Stetson Avenue, and State Street.[21]\n[edit] Railroad\n\nThe railroad to Hemet was operated by AT&SF Railway from 1888 to 1987. It was used back then for loading and shipping oranges that grew in the region. In 1987, it was abandoned because of a lack of demand for transportation. Today, the railroad is mostly abandoned and very little happens on this line. The tracks are usually used for storing rail cars for a short time while they are not needed by Class I railroads. In the future, the city of Hemet is planning to remove all crossings and pave over the tracks to reduce the roughness of the crossings. This will most likely cut off the rail line to Hemet, so no more rail cars or locomotives will be heading into the city.\n[edit] Public safety\n[edit] Law enforcement\nHemet Police Department, built in 1959\n\nPolice headquarters is located at the corner of Buena Vista Avenue and Latham Avenue in the downtown area. The force was formed in the early 20th century, and has been the police force for Hemet since then. The force regularly responds to all types of calls, in extreme situations, S.W.A.T. is called in. In 2008, the police department responded to over 70,000 incidents and made over 5000 arrests. The police department includes 94 employees: 68 sworn officers, 26 civilians, and 68 volunteers (FY09/10). Hemet P.D. maintains some of the highest arrest and closure rates in the entire county. The department operates on an annual budget of $13.7 million, and is supplemented by about $350,000 in Federal grants. The Department was cut from 91 sworn officers to 68 officers because of budget cuts in 2009. The Police Chief, Richard Dana, retired in February 2011 after a 47 year career in law enforcement.[22] On August 9, 2011 20+ year department veteran, Dave Brown, was sworn in as the new Police Chief.\n[edit] Fire department\n\nThe fire department was started in 1908, predating the incorporation of the city itself. The headquarters is located on 510 E. Florida Avenue, and it currently operates four fire stations in the city. The department recently had to close a fifth station, due to tough economic times. The department estimated that it will respond to about 12,000 calls in 2009.[23]\n[edit] Library\nHemet Public Library, located in downtown\n\nThe City of Hemet public library was created in 1906 when citizens wanted a place to gather and read various books. Members of the Women's Club opened a reading room at the corner of Harvard street, and Florida avenue.\n\nIn 1910 after the city had incorporated, citizens of the newly formed city voted for its own library, and the city took over the operation of the facility built in 1906. Shortly after, the reading room became too small for the growing community, and groups and citizens lobbied to get a new larger facility built. This would help to house the growing collection of books. A woman of the community named Mrs. E.A. Davis was on the one who wrote to Andrew Carnegie seeking funds to help build a new library. The city received $7,500 to fund part of the construction, and Mr. and Mrs. St. John donated land to the city to build the new Carnegie Library. The new library was finished in 1913, and served the city for 52 years. The building was declared unsafe by the Fire Marshall, and the building was razed in 1969, and the new C.B. Covell memorial Library was built. This building however, also became to small for the city.\n\nThe library moved again in 2003, to its current facility, re-located for the first time since 1913. The new facility is now located at 300 North Latham Avenue. Just blocks from its former location. The new building is two stories tall, and contains 52,000 square feet (4,800 m2). It was designed by John Loomis of 30th Street Architects.[24][25]				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemet,_California

478	4364	1		Ipswich is the county town of Suffolk, England. It is located on the estuary of the River Orwell.	Ipswich enjoys a maritime climate with a narrow range of temperature and rainfall spread evenly throughout the year. Ipswich's beautiful parks are an important part of the town's heritage. Residents and visitors can access more than 500 hectares of green space and wildlife habitats all across the town. In addition, many houses include gardens and many residents feed the birds and encourage wildlife. There are over 2,100 allotment plots at 16 sites across Ipswich, covering an area of 60 hectares. Like many ports up and down the country, Ipswich Waterfront, has been, and still is undergoing a major transformation.\n\nIpswich's numerous high quality and diverse green spaces are of regional significance. The town parks such as Holywells, Chantry and Christchurch are rich in wildlife and as such are designated County Wildlife Sites. In addition, Ipswich has some special nature reserves such as Bixley Heath Site of Special Scientific Interest.\nAnother highlight is nearby Orwell Country Park, 230 acres of Ancient Woodland and heathland situated upon the stunning Orwell Estuary, and inside the Suffolk Coast & Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\nThe Ipswich Wildlife and Education Rangers are responsible for the management of wildlife areas within these green spaces. As well as carrying out practical management the team run the events programme and works with many local schools to engage and inspire the public about the wildlife Ipswich has to offer.\nThe Ipswich Ranger Service works closely with the Suffolk Biodiversity Project. See http://www.suffolkbiodiversity.org/ for more information.

483	4417	1			The larger Oak Basin block includes small valleys and ridges ranging in elevation from 550 feet to 2160 feet in the foothills of the Cascades. South and west aspects, which occupy half of the total acreage, generally support oak and oak savanna. Many areas have also been planted with native ponderosa pine which grows well on droughty soils. North and east aspects support Douglas fir, grand fir, and big leaf maple. Moist and dry meadows are dispersed throughout the property. Many of the valleys provide secluded areas attractive to deer, elk, and bear. Silver gray squirrels, ruffed grouse, wild turkeys, and both mountain and valley quail abound on the property.\n\nPrior to our ownership the farm was part of a large cattle operation and was heavily logged. Since our initial purchase in 1994, we have planted more than 350 thousand ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, western red cedar, and incense cedar seedlings to reestablish forest stands. We have also commercially thinned 70 acres of Douglas fir and have removed invasive conifers from over one-hundred acres of oak woodland.\n\nOregon white oak stands are one of the rarest natural habitats in the Northwest. Less than two percent of the Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) habitat, that once dominated the Willamette valley, remains, and most of this habitat is contained on private land. Oak Basin contains some of the largest intact parcels of oak and oak savanna habitat remaining in the southern Willamette valley with some stands exceeding 150 years of age (presettlement oak). Oak Basin is home to the endangered Fender’s Blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi) and many other rare plant and vertebrate species associated with Oregon white oak woodlands and savanna. We are actively restoring these areas by removing the competing vegetation, mowing the brush, prescribe burning, and reestablishing native grasses and forbs.\nOur primary objective is to demonstrate that a sustainable flow of harvestable timber can be produced from a property that is managed for native species protection. We believe that habitat protection can best be achieved by active management. We follow practices which will sustain and improve habitat for threatened and endangered species. This includes the restoration, maintenance, and expansion of existing oak habitat and the responsible management of all forested types. We strive to be an example to others that management can be ecologically sustainable while returning profits and services to the landowner.\n\nOur management is consistent with the goal of ecological sustainability nurtured by the Forest Stewardship Council. We have chosen to join and retain our membership in the Northwest Natural Resource Group (NNRG) to insure that our management continues to meet the highest possible ecological standards. We are working to establish a Conservation Easement on all or a portion of our property and desire that it remains undeveloped in perpetuity. Being an actively managed tree farm, we also sell logs, lumber, and other forest products that are certified as being green and sustainably produced by FSC.  The management of Oak Basin tree farm would not be possible without the assistance of many active partners.\n\nOak Basin tree farm is certified by both the American Tree Farm System (ATFS) and by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Ed Merzenich was the western Oregon runner-up in the ATFS competition in the year 2000. We will continue to work closely with both of these associations. We aspire to be Oregon Tree Farmers of the year based on our restoration work.		private property

485	4481	5	Core Chicago Region	The landscape surrounding the Chicago metropolis is a melting pot of woodlands, savannas, wetlands, and prairie, where the eastern deciduous forest meets the farmlands of the plains. And all is wrapped around the south end of Lake Michigan and overlaid on a diverse foundation of old dune ridges, moraines, and other glacial features. The variety of plant communities supports a very diverse composition of fungi (mycota or mycobiota). There are more than 1,000 species of macro-fungi found within this area. The primary reason for the level of fungal diversity is the wide range of habitats found here which in turn is based on the diversity of plants and the geographic and geologic features of the area. \n\nDespite the 130 year history of mycology collections here, much of this region has little or no documentation of its fungi. Only Cook County, Illinois, and Porter County, Indiana, can be said to be well documented. As of 2010, these two counties comprise 88% of all collections because of the 16 years of research in Cook County Forest Preserves and Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Other counties that have over 300 historical and recent collections are DeKalb, DuPage, and Lake Counties in Illinois, and Lake County, Indiana. Of course, this pattern of spotty documentation is similar for many other states. There are a dozen type collections of fungi for the region from seven counties. Several undescribed species await further study and publication. \n\nTaken from my page at http://www.vplants.org/fungi/diversity.html\n\nUpdate: starting in 2011, McHenry County has 10 or more sites being sampled for fungi in woodlands and savannas.

488	673	1		Bovec basin is located in the Julian Alps, which are a part of most south-eastern Alps. It is situated in north-west Slovenia. The basin has about 450 m elevation at the bottom and is surrounded on the northwest and north side by Mt. Kanin mountain group with elevations up to 2.500m and  on the east and south side by diverse peaks of East Julian alps (peak elevations up to 2.100m). On the southwest site the basin is connected to Adriatic Sea region through deep and relatively narrow Soča river valley. Through this 'opening' surprisingly many submediterranean influences enter Bovec basin which is manifested by many warmth loving species growing in it. It is generally considered as a part of alpine phytogeographical region, although some authors consider a part of it as subalpine phytogeographical region. The region has average temperatures about 8-10 deg C in the valleys and below 0 deg C on the mountain ridges. There is about 3.000 mm of precipitations per year, partly snow, which makes this region the most precipitation rich part of Slovenia. The bedrock is totally calcareous: mostly limestone, dolomite and flysh. There is no acid rock. The region is rich in water; its characteristic is low pollution (almost no industry) and very high biodiversity.  				
489	2769	5		Bavščica valley is situated northeast of Bovec in northwest Slovenia. It is a typical glacial alpine valley of East Julian Alps. At the bottom the elevations are low, slightly above 400 m, but the surrounding mountain peaks range from 1.800 to 2.400 m. At the entrance to the valley there is a short, picturesque stream Šumnik which flows into river Koritnica, one of the largest tributaries of river Soča. The region is still mostly pristine and has very large biodiversity. It is a part of Triglav National Park.	Geologically the valley is calcareous, mostly limestone and dolomite. The bottom of the valley is covered by old cultural land, mostly pastures, some still in use. The rest, up to the tree level, are woods with dominant Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies, and upland mountain grassland above it. In the valley only a few people still reside. The region receives more than 3.000 mm/year precipitations.

490	739	1		Zadnja Trenta valley is situated in the heart of East Julian Alps. It is a typical alpine valley with elevations of about 800 m at the bottom, surrounded by mountain ridges from 2.000 m to 2.300 m high.  The highest peak is Mt. Jalovec (2.645 m) at the northwest of the valley. It is the 6.th highest peak in the Julian Alps and in the country. Soča River springs in the valley. The valley has a unique position because it is closed almost on all sides. There are no submediterranean influences in it as it is the case with the middle and the lower Trenta valley. The region is still pristine, not inhabited, with a single narrow dirt road in its lower part. The mountain peaks on the south east side as well on its northwest side are today almost untouched by man, although the upland grassland was used for goat and sheep grassing centuries ago. There are no public trails across these peaks. The region has very large biodiversity and belongs 100% to Triglav National Park.	Geologically the valley is calcareous, mostly limestone. At the bottom of the valley there is some cultural land. These are exclusively old pastures, some still in use. The rest is woods with dominant Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies, and Larix decidua and Pinus mugo at the high elevations. Above tree line there are extensive subalpine and alpine meadows with rich alpine flora. The region receives more than 3.000 mm/year precipitations. The average temperatures are about 6-8 deg C at the bottom and below 0 deg C at the mountain peaks. Mycologically the region is practically not researched.

494	4886	1		KCTS-TV is a public television station in Seattle, Washington, that is a member of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), that broadcasts on digital channel 9. Its offices and broadcasting center are located at the northeast corner of Seattle Center. Its transmitter is located 1.9 miles east on Capitol Hill in Seattle.\n\nKCTS also operates KYVE in Yakima, Washington (digital channel 21, PSIP channel 47), which serves as the PBS member station for the western portion of the Yakima/Tri-Cities market. It has its own studio on Second Street in Yakima, though some support operations are based at KCTS' studios.\n\nEffective June 12, 2009, KCTS's broadcasts are digital-only.\n\nKCTS first went on the air on December 7, 1954, broadcasting from the campus of the University of Washington and using equipment donated by KING-TV owner Dorothy Bullitt.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, KCTS primarily supplied classroom instructional programs used in Washington State's K–12 schools, plus National Educational Television programs. Outside of schoolrooms, KCTS' audience among the general public was somewhat limited, and most programming was in black-and-white until the mid-'70s.\nKCTS studios at Seattle Center\n\nIn 1970, National Educational Television was absorbed into the newly created Public Broadcasting Service. Under PBS affiliation, KCTS began offering a vastly enhanced scope of programming for the general public, including British programming. KCTS is perhaps best known for producing/distributing the popular PBS Kids show Bill Nye the Science Guy, as well as other programs such as Students by Nature (not a PBS-distributed program), The Miracle Planet, and the annual televised high school academic competition KYVE Apple Bowl, among other shows.\n\nKCTS moved to its present location on the Seattle Center campus in 1986. A year later, UW spun off KCTS, and the station became a community licensee.\n\nKCTS is seen throughout southwestern British Columbia on local cable systems, as well as across Canada on the Bell TV and Shaw Direct satellite providers, as well as on many other Canadian cable TV systems. According to KCTS, "over 800,000 viewers tune in every week" from BC.[4] KCTS receives substantial financial support from its far-flung Canadian audience as well as from viewers in Washington State.\nKCTS's logo from 1999 until late 2006\n\nIn 1994, KCTS merged with KYVE, which has served central Washington since November 1, 1962. However, this wasn't the first time that the two stations had partnered together; during the early 1960s KYVE's engineers switched to and from KCTS' signal until the station got enough funding to be self-supporting. During the mid- and late-1990s, some programs included a combined KCTS/KYVE visual bug in the lower-right corner of the screen, indicating they were simulcast to both markets. However, since the late 1990s, KYVE has largely been a straight simulcast of KCTS. Combined, the two stations serve 2.4 million people, including almost two-thirds of Washington's population.\n\nKCTS also operates a cable television service known as KCTS Plus, currently carried on Seattle area cable systems. KCTS Plus runs 24-hour Classic Arts Showcase programming.\n\nFrom 1999 until late-2006, KCTS used a logo similar to the ones used by Detroit's WTVS and Houston's KUHT. These stations are members of LARK International, a public-television production company, which owns the sunburst-on-square logo; however, they are not related to each other.\n[edit] Transmitter Failure\n\nOn December 23, 2006 one of KCTS's analog transmitters failed, leaving the station no other choice but to operate at 158 kW, about half their licensed power. They requested a Special Temporary Authority from the FCC, and it was granted on February 20, 2007. On August 2, 2007 they requested an extension of the STA. They had the transmitter parts on order from NEC Japan.\n\nKCTS was returned to full power operation in December, 2007 just about one year after the initial failure. It remained at full power until October 2008 at which time one of the NEC analog transmitters was removed from the building to make room for a brand new Rohde & Schwarz digital transmitter for operation on channel 9.\n\nOn June 12, 2009 the remaining NEC analog transmitter, indeed actually the one that originally failed, was shut down and the Rohde put into service as part of the nationwide transition to digital broadcasting.\n\nSeattle Center is a park and arts and entertainment center in Seattle, Washington. The 74-acre (300,000 m2) campus is the site used in 1962 by the Century 21 Exposition. It is located just north of Belltown in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood.\n\nAttractions\n\n    The International Fountain: located in the middle of the campus, the fountain operates all year round. Built for the 1962 World's Fair, the fountain was built as a modernist water sculpture. With over 20 spouts, the fountain goes through programmed cycles of shooting water patterns, accompanied by recorded world music. The music is changed every month, and chosen to coordinate with the water patterns. Since 2004, World Naked Bike Ride Seattle (and later Body Pride Ride) clothing-optional bike rides often have the fountain as a major stop during their events.[1]\n    The Space Needle, an official city landmark[1]\n    Seattle Center Monorail terminus\n    Center House (formerly known as the Food Circus).

Elevations range from below 1,000 feet to over 9,000 feet.\n\nMore than 700 lakes and mountain ponds dot the glacier-carved terrain of nearby Alpine Lake Wilderness. Tree-covered valleys give way to rocky ridges and rugged peaks along the crest of the Cascades. Many peaks and slopes are permanently cloaked in snowfields. From wet forests of Douglas fir, cedar, and an understory of salal and berries, to firs and mountain hemlock, the landscape opens up to expansive meadows matted with low growth and ends with dry forestland of ponderosa pine and grasses.\n\nCongress designated the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in 1976 with a total of 362,789 acres. Prior to designation, aggressive mining and logging operations punched numerous access roads into the area, creating a wildly irregular boundary to this popular area.\nRecreation:\n\nEightmile Group Campground offers outdoor enthusiasts the opportunity to hike, fish, bike and enjoy a long list of outdoor recreational activities throughout the year. This campground has plenty of trails to explore by bike.\n\nAnglers may want to cast a line into the deep pools at nearby Toketie Lake. Populations of rainbow and cutthroat trout find habitat in this somewhat secluded lake.\n\nThe nearby Fourth of July Trail offers hikers expansive ridge line views and challenging terrain. Beginning in the forest at 4,000 feet, the trail quickly climbs in elevation, out of the trees into more open, arid landscapes. The trail continues, traversing through mountain meadows with spectacular views of the Stuart Mountain Range and Icicle Valley. At 10.6 miles, this is a solid day hike, though backpackers can hook up connecting trails to continue for multiple days though adjacent wilderness settings.\nFacilities:\n\nEightmile Group Campground has one large site that can accommodate up to 70 guests and 25 vehicles. The site is equipped with picnic tables, a group campfire ring, drinking water and vault toilets.\nNearby Attractions:\n\nVisitors enjoy the North Cascades and Mt. Rainer National Parks, where interpretive programs and exhibits offer education about the diverse landscape and history of the area.\n\nGuests can also explore the area's colorful railroad and mining history at the Steven's Pass Historic District, or hit the slopes at Steven's Pass Ski Area.				http://www.reserveamerica.com/campgroundDetails.do?subTabIndex=0&&contractCode=nrso&parkCode=eigh

502	1496	1		Lacey is a city in Thurston County, Washington, United States. Established as a suburb of Olympia, its population was 42,393 at the 2010 census out of a county population of 252,264.\n\nLacey was originally called Woodland after settlers Isaac and Catherine Wood, who claimed land there in 1853.[5] The small settlements of Woodland and Chambers Creek consolidated into Lacey in the 1950s. Renamed for attorney and developer O.C. Lacey, the city of Lacey was officially incorporated on December 5, 1966. At the time, the main industries were cattle, milk, forest products, and retail. Lacey became a commuter town for Olympia, Fort Lewis[6] and to some extent, Tacoma; in recent years, however, business developments, community groups, and population growth have led Lacey to develop into a city in its own right.\nBusiness\n\nLacey sported one of the Northwest's first ever "indoor malls", South Sound Center. It has since been partially demolished and turned into an outdoor shopping center. Lacey now features a diverse array of businesses, ranging from retail to warehousing/distribution centers, a large retirement community, a major mushroom farm, and Weyerhaeuser's corrugated container facility.\n\nAs Lacey continues to grow, many businesses continue to feed into the city. Lacey now offers a Regal 16 Movie Theater, which is one of the largest theaters in the area. Other businesses that have recently come into Lacey include LA Fitness, Best Buy, Costco, The Home Depot, Lowe's, Cabela's and many strip malls and market squares. There is also speculation that NFL Washington Redskins Fullback Mike Sellers, a North Thurston High School alumni, may seek to build a multi-sport event center or football dome in Hawks Prairie, which could attract national competitions.[citation needed]\nEcology\n\nLacey was the twelfth city to be designated an official "Green Power Community" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for its use of renewable energy sources; 5% of its total energy use comes from green power sources.[7] It is working to meet its Alternative Energy Initiative, which includes "using 100 percent green electrical energy in all of its municipal buildings, parks, utilities, and 3,000 streetlights and traffic signals; providing electric vehicle charging stations to visitors and employees at its city hall and library campus; and initiating conversion of its municipal fleet to energy efficient vehicles powered by electricity, hybrid technology, and 80/20 biofuel."[8] In 2009, Lacey's Alternative Energy Fair was honored with the Award of Excellence for Events, Fairs, and Festivals by the Washington Recreation and Park Association.[8] Lacey has received the "Tree City, USA" designation from the National Arbor Day Foundation for the past eighteen years.[9]\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 16.3 square miles (42.3 km²), of which, 15.9 square miles (41.3 km²) of it is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km²) of it (2.27%) is water.\nDemographics\nHistorical populations\nCensus \tPop. \t\t%±\n1970 \t9,696 \t\t\n—\n1980 \t13,940 \t\t43.8%\n1990 \t19,279 \t\t38.3%\n2000 \t31,226 \t\t62.0%\n2010 \t42,393 \t\t35.8%\nU.S. Decennial Census\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 42,393 people, 16,459 households, and 10,148 families residing in the city.[10] The population density was 2,557.8 people per square mile (755.9/km²).

510	1522	1		Randle is an unincorporated community in extreme eastern Lewis County, Washington, United States. Randle is located on U.S. Route 12 and is notable as the northeastern access point to the Mount St. Helens Windy Ridge viewpoint, by way of forest service roads that cut through the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Randle is located right next to the Cowlitz River and is about four miles north of the Cispus River, a tributary of the Cowlitz. The rural area surrounding Randle is known locally as the "Big Bottom Valley," which is reflective of the fact that the valley floor in which the Cowlitz River winds westward through Randle is "big"--flat, fertile land that is at places more than 3 miles wide.\n\nWilliam Joerk explored in the area around 1882. Randle was first settled in 1886 by James L. Randle. The townsite was founded in 1902.[1]\n\nIn 1952, The White Pass High School was built. In 2011, it was torn down and built into a new school.\nGeography\n\nRandle is the center of the White Pass School District, which, in addition to Randle, covers the small towns of Glenoma, Washington, and Packwood, Washington (its school district jurisdiction includes a vast rural expanse in extreme eastern Lewis County, terminating at the Cascade Mountains and the county border with Yakima County).

511	5225	1		White Pass (el. 873 m or 2,864 ft) is a mountain pass through the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains on the border of the U.S. state of Alaska and the province of British Columbia, Canada. It leads from Skagway, Alaska to the chain of lakes at the headwaters of the Yukon River, Crater Lake, Lake Lindeman and Bennett Lake.\n\nThe White Pass was closely controlled by the Chilkoot Indians and was unknown to non-natives until 1887. William Ogilvie had heard reports of a low pass from the head of Chilkoot Inlet to the headwaters of the Lewes River (Yukon River), while in Juneau. In June 1887 Ogilvie was at the head of Taiya Inlet doing a survey from Pyramid Island up through the Chilkoot Pass. William Moore, who was accompanying him, had experience building roads in mountainous areas and wanted to try this route since the Chilkoot Pass was reported to be too steep for a wagon road. Ogilvie made inquiries and learned there was such a pass; but could not induce any Chilkoots to guide Moore. Skookum Jim Mason had been through this low altitude pass before, and with much talk and encouragement he was induced to reveal it. Ogilvie sent Moore and Skookum Jim Mason over this low altitude pass while he continued with his surveying work on the Chilkoot Pass.[1] Moore did a rough survey of the new pass and returned with the satisfaction that he had found the route for his wagon road. The White Pass was named for the Canadian Minister of the Interior Thomas White by William Ogilvie.[2]\n\nWilliam Moore and his son returned to stake a homesteader's claim in Skagua; as it was then known. They built a cabin and a wharf and surveyed a town site they called Mooresville. In 1894 the North-West Mounted Police arrive at Dyea and Mooresville on their way to the Canada's Yukon territory. The first group of prospectors hiked up Moore's crude trail over the White Pass. Once the gold rush began the Moores were over-run. Mooresville was resurveyed by Frank Reid as Skaguay. The crude trail was made into a toll road by George Brackett and the North-West Mounted Police guarded the passes and briefly maintained a post in Skaguay, which Canada claimed.[3]\nWhite Pass summit seen from train, 2002\nGold Rush Years\nSee also: Skagway Historic District and White Pass\n\nThe White Pass Trail, was one of the two main passes used by prospectors during the Klondike Gold Rush. The White Pass was an easier route to Lake Bennett than the Chilkoot Trail a few kilometers to the west, but it harbored a criminal element that preyed on the cheechakos (newcomers to the Klondike). These con artists were believed to be members of the infamous Soapy Smith gang from Skagway, Alaska. In 1898 Smith was killed at the famed Shootout on Juneau Wharf and his gang were run out of Skagway and the White Pass. So many horses died during the Gold rush that the trail became known as the "Dead Horse Trail". The trail ended at Lake Bennett, where the prospectors built or purchased rafts or boats to float down the Yukon River to the Klondike gold fields near Dawson City.\n\nThe White Pass and Yukon Route narrow gauge railroad was built 1898-1900[4] through White Pass. The southern end of the Klondike Highway also uses the White Pass and parallels the railway.\n\nThe Skagway Historic District and White Pass is a U.S. National Historic Landmark.

513	5146	1	Cheney Wetland Trail, Spokane Co., Washington, USA	About 25 miles southwest of the city of Spokane, in the heart of the more moist area of the Channeled Scablands, a globally unique geological formation created by massive Ice Age Floods. The trail goes around natural and artificial wetlands - the city of Cheney uses these wetlands as the last stage in their waste water treatment process. The area is over 200 acres of green space used by the locals for jogging, dog walking, hiking and cross country skiing.	The eastern area of the Channeled Scablands is striking in its juxtaposition of arid Ponderosa Pine forest community bordered by year round wetlands.\n\n+Geology+: Columnar basalt and granite erratics. The foothills of the Rocky Mountains are only 30-40 miles east.\n\n+Plant Communities+: Ponderosa pine community: snowberry, meadows of arrowleaf balsamroot and _Lomatium_\n\nWetland community: cattails, reeds, rushes; invasion by reed canary grass.\n\n+Climate+: Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and fall (17 inches per year average) and snow in the winter (42 inches average), and hot dry summer (average high 85 degrees), with chilly nights (~50 degrees) and lots of dew present in the morning.\n\nThis area is a major stopping point for many migratory birds, particularly the Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge which is located only a few miles from this trail. . 	Common: _Letharia vulpina_, _Letharia columbiana_, _Vulpicida canadensis_.\n\nInteresting: sorediated _Evernia prunastri_ due to euthropic air pollution. Moose, arrived only 10 years ago, migrated down from the northern Rockies. Elk.Marmots (locally known as whistlepigs).\n	This is a public green space area. \n\nDirections: Go into the middle of the town of Cheney, WA, about 20 miles southwest of the city of Spokane, off Rt. 90. In the town of Cheney, turn onto Cheney-Spangle road, go down a few miles, you’ll see the parking lot for the Columbia Plateau Trail State Park, pull into the parking lot there, park (you need a Discover Washington Pass, or pay a parking fee at the kiosk, or don’t worry about it and risk a parking ticket) you have two choices to get over to the public (non-state park area) wetlands.\n\n1) and at the end of the parking lot you’ll see a dirt road that’s blocked off and say’s no trespassing, thats a sign for non-locals. Just wigggle through the gate, go down the dirt road, you’ll still be on state park property for about 100 yards so if you have a dog keep him on a leash in case a ranger is there. Then you’ll come up a hill and be overlooking the sewage treatment plant and their managed pond and series of wetlands.\n\n2) go east down the columbia plateau trail, its pretty neat, its going through a canyon right there, about 10 feet wide, but the walls go up at least 20-30, gorgeous. You’ll come to a little area next to the sewage treatment plant, head towards the pond and wetlands along the dirt road, its just about 25 feet, now you’re on the public green space.\n\nThere’s a trail that goes along each side of that first kinda square wetland (its more natural as you get further back, and doesn’t smell too bad, mostly like laundry deterent on bad days and only at that first pond), there is one basic loop, you can take a short version of that loop, or a longer extended version of the loop, just stay on the trails and you’ll find your way back home again. And there’s lots of locals that walk, jog around there so there’ll be someone around if you get lost and don’t have a compass/GPS unit.

514	5231	1		Mercer Island is a city in King County, Washington, United States and the name of the island in Lake Washington on which the city sits. The population was 22,699 at the 2010 census.\n\nLocated in the Seattle Metropolitan Area,[3] it is the most populated island in a lake within the United States.[4] The ZIP code 98040 is unique to Mercer Island.[5]\n\nMercer Island, named for the Mercer family of Seattle, was first settled between 1870 and 1880. The Mercer brothers often rowed between the island and Seattle to pick berries, hunt, and fish. Those brothers, Thomas Mercer and Asa Shinn Mercer, are members of the Mercer family of Virginia and are supposed relatives of The Shins frontman, James R Mercer[citation needed]. The first large settlement, East Seattle, was toward the northwest side of the island—near the McGilvara neighbourhood. During 1889, a C C Calkins built a large and gilded resort, the Calkins Hotel. The hotel was patronised via steamboat between: Madison Park, Leschi Park, and the Eastside. Burnt by a mysterious fire, the hotel was razed during 1908.\n\nThe Calkins Landing continued service and assumedly aided location of a more permanent population. Residents would summer on Mercer Island, then most similar to the San Juan Islands and the Hamptons. A denser urban community with business district developed toward the central northern island between the McGilvara neighbourhood and Luther Burbank Park, within the latter of which a boarding school was built, and now composes the majority of the island's crest through the Middle Island neighbourhood. To connect with a similar municipality, Bellevue, the East Channel Bridge was built and opened during 1928. George W Lightfoot, during 1930, requested a bridge between Mercer Island and Seattle; the Lacey V Murrow Memorial Bridge, second longest floating bridge on Earth, was built and opened during 1940. A second bridge, named for the sake of Albert D Rosellini, between Seattle and Medina, Governor Albert D Rosellini Bridge—Evergreen Point, longest floating bridge on Earth, was built and opened during 1963. A third bridge, fifth longest floating bridge on Earth, Homer M Hadley Memorial Bridge, was built parallel to the Lacey V Murrow Memorial Bridge and opened during 1989. The East Channel Bridge, Lacey V Murrow Memorial Bridge, and Homer M Hadley Memorial Bridge, carry Interstate 90.\n\nThe City of Mercer Island was incorporated from East Seattle on 5 July 1960 and composed of all the island less the 70 acre (280,000 m²) business district. Just over one month later, 9 August, the Town of Mercer Island was incorporated from that business district. The two aforementioned municipalities merged as the City of Mercer Island 19 May 1970.\n\nLuther Burbank Park covers 77 acres (310,000 m2) of land and has 0.75 miles (1.2 km) of waterfront. The park has a public boat dock and fishing pier, a swimming beach, an amphitheater, tennis courts, barbecues and picnic facilities, and an off-leash dog area.[11] The city assumed maintenance of the park on January 1, 2003 from King County, which had purchased the park land in 1969.[12]\n\nThe Park on the Lid is atop the I-90 tunnel entrances. This park has softball fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, picnic shelters, and the Freeway Sculpture Park. [13] [14] Pioneer Park covers 113 acres (0.46 km2) and has equestrian, bicycle, and hiking trails.[15] Deane's Children Park, also known as "Dragon Park", is a small park with playground equipment.[16]\nSister cities\n\nMercer Island's sister city, as designated by Sister Cities International, is Thonon-les-Bains, France.[17][18]\nAnnual events\n\n    Mercer Island is focal to annual performances by the Blue Angels during Seattle's summer Seafair celebration.\n    Summer Celebration is a celebration once a year on the weekend after the 4th of July. The celebration ends with fireworks.\n		Tuber gibbosum		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_Island,_Washington

517	1521	1		Tumwater is a city in Thurston County, Washington, United States. It lies near where the Deschutes River enters Budd Inlet, the southernmost point of Puget Sound. The population was 17,371 at the 2010 census. Thurston County, which includes the cities of Lacey, Olympia and Tumwater, has a population of 252,264.\n\nTumwater was founded next to the falls of the Deschutes River at the south end of Puget Sound as New Market in 1846 by a group of pioneers led by Michael Simmons and George Bush. It was the first American settlement on Puget Sound. These early settlers were attracted by the water-power potential from the falls, the easy access to Budd Inlet for shipping, and the open prairie land in the area for cattle grazing.\n\nA major factor driving the Simmons-Bush Party to locate north of the Columbia River beyond Oregon Territory is that the American settlers in Oregon prohibited settlement by non-whites to avoid the contentious slavery issue. Bush, a mulatto, was not allowed to own land under Oregon law. Later, when the area north of the Columbia became part of US territory, white settlers petitioned Congress to grant Bush title to his land, which was approved.\n\nThe name was changed to Tumwater borrowing from a Chinook Jargon phrase tumtum chuck meaning "waterfall" or "rapids" (literally "heartbeat water"). Despite its early settlement date, Tumwater wasn't officially incorporated until November 12, 1875.\n\nFor many years Tumwater was well known regionally as the home of the Olympia Brewing Company. The company began producing beer in 1896 at a site along the Deschutes River and continued until Prohibition. After Prohibition ended, a new brewery was erected just upstream from the original site. This brewery was eventually purchased by SABMiller and closed on July 1, 2003.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumwater,_Washington

A pedestrian bridge across the main lines of the BNSF Railway connects to the Carkeek Park sand beach on Puget Sound. Park program activities are largely out of the Carkeek Park Environmental Education Center.\n\nVehicles can enter the park from either NW 117th Street or NW 110th Street via Carkeek Park Road, a winding drive down a steep wooded hillside. Park access is more pedestrian-friendly. Pedestrians can reach the park at NW 117th Street (near 12th Avenue NW), 12th Avenue NW (near NW 116th Street), NW 116th Street (near the main vehicle entrance), NW 107th Street (near 4th Avenue NW), NW 105th Street (near 3rd Avenue NW), NW 100th Place (near 6th Avenue NW), and NW Norcross Way (near 12th Avenue NW).\n\nSeattle's first park to be called Carkeek Park was on Pontiac Bay, Lake Washington (1918–1926), now site of Magnuson Park. The original was a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Morgan J. Carkeek, prominent builder and contractor in Seattle, Oregon, and Victoria, B.C. The original was displaced by a Naval Air Station. Morgan Carkeek offered the proceeds of his sale to the City for another park.\nA century-old apple tree in Piper Orchard\n\nMost of the existing site was purchased by the City of Seattle in the later 1920s, with 20% donated by Carkeek, following citizen petition over vigorous City opposition. The park went through a few themes over years, from outdoor performance venue, to farm for zoo animal feed, to pasturage rental, to park with WPA Civilian Conservation Corps construction (1933-–36, removed in 1938), to U.S. Army camp (just in 1942), to sewage treatment plant (over vigorous opposition by neighborhoods groups). Bond funds in the late 1940s allowed reconstruction of park facilities, including a planned large equestrian academy and concession to reduce chronic rowdyism in the park, but a tight city budget in spite of generous donations forced indefinite postponement. An archery field was built (c. 1955), and ended in 1963 as fencing become prohibitive. Treated sewage outfall ended in the early 1960s with closure of the treatment plant and replacement with a Metro sewage pumping station near the parking lot for the beach.\n\nAdditional property was donated in 1953 but could not be incorporated until the city could raise funds to buy the intervening ravine in 1973.\n\nThe park and environs were still rural when the park was established; further, most of the park is in a steep little canyon, so the park was spared all but minimal rural development as well as the surrounding boom of urban development. The full old growth forest (1,000–2,000 years old) was all clearcut relatively early (around the early 20th century); the predominantly maple-alder successional stage forest is today mature. Evergreens will gradually predominate. Typical trees include deciduous maple, alder, ash, and willow, with madrona, cascere, and evergreen Western Red Cedar, Western Hemlock, Douglas fir, pine, and spruce. Sedges, cattails, and other common indigenous flora fill out the understory and wetland areas, with particularly huge Lady Ferns along the ravine between 105th and 110th streets.\nWild Redflower Currant (Ribes sanguineum) blooming\n\nIn addition to the variety of program activities and environmental stewardship, the community-driven Carkeek Park Environmental Learning Center (ELC) is becoming a model for resource efficiency and protection of human health and the environment. Built to the highest standard of the U.S. Green Building Council, sustainable building features of the ELC include:\n\n    rooftop rainwater harvest for flushing toilets and managing storm water. This is becoming dramatically more attractive for large buildings and as potable water is becoming scarce (and expensive);\n    energy-efficient highly-insulated building envelope, intelligent lighting, and natural ventilation (some is rediscovery: natural lighting and ventilation were common before electricity);\n    solar electric (photovoltaic) panels provided by City Light's Green Power program\n    80% recycling or salvaging of demolition and construction waste;\n    salmon-friendly landscaping, meaning drought-tolerant, native species and increased storm water infiltration;\n    paints and coatings, adhesives, sealants, wood composites and carpeting which protect indoor air quality;\n    recycled content products were used in construction: concrete, backfill, wood composite casework, insulation, and flooring; salvaged materials included peeler logs from a naval building in South Lake Union; and\n    regional materials were preferred, supporting the regional economy and reducing the energy, waste, and pollution associated with transportation (one of the biggest components of fossil fuel and energy use).\n				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carkeek_Park

520	3430	1		a city in King County, Washington, United States, located south of Seattle. As of the 2010 Census, Burien's population is 33,313, which is a 2.9% increase since incorporation. Annexation in 2011 has increased the cities population to about 45,000.\n\nEuropean settlement in the Burien area dates to 1870, when Mike Kelly walked up a hill from the Seattle area. When he emerged from the trees he said, "This is truly a sunny dale." Today, a few long-time residents still refer to the Burien area as Sunnydale. He claimed a 160-acre (0.6 km2) plot of land and built a house and a farm.\n\nTen years later, Gottlieb Von Boorian, a German immigrant, arrived in Sunnydale, which was only a community of trails and small houses without roads or commercial buildings. Von Boorian built a cabin on the southeast corner of Lake Burien and reportedly formed the community into a town bearing his name (misspelled over the years). A real estate office was built and soon attracted large numbers of new residents to Burien.\n\nIn the early 1900s, visitors from Seattle came by the Mosquito Fleet to Three Tree Point, just west of town to sunbathe and swim.\n\nIn 1915, the Lake Burien Railway was completed. It ran on what is today Ambaum Boulevard from Burien to White Center to Seattle. A small passenger train ran the tracks and was affectionately named by the residents, The Toonerville Trolley. However in the summer, squished caterpillars made the track slippery, and in the winter, the tracks iced over. Soon the Toonerville Trolley was removed.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burien,_Washington
521	3168	1		The Elwha Dam was a 108-ft (33 m) high dam located in the United States, in the state of Washington, on the Elwha River approximately 4.9 miles (7.9 km) upstream from the mouth of the river on the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The dam was built under the direction of Thomas Aldwell. Aldwell previously bought up tracts of land around the river, and with the help of Canadian financier George Glines, began construction of the Elwha Dam in 1910.\n\nAldwell and his contractors cut corners on constructing the dam, including not building fish passages and did not secure it to the bedrock.[2] Thus, in 1912, as the reservoir filled behind the nearly completed dam, the lower sections of the dam gave way and a torrent of water headed downstream, taking out a bridge. Aldwell was able to get funding for reconstructing the dam and it was completed in 1913. The reservoir that fills the valley behind it is now known as Lake Aldwell.\n\nInitially, along with the Glines Canyon Dam, which was completed in 1926, it helped to fuel economic growth and development for the Olympic Peninsula and the community of Port Angeles, Washington. However, today the combined power output of both dams only provides the equivalent of 38% of the electricity needed to operate one paper mill, the Daishowa America mill.[citation needed]\n\nLacking passage for migrating salmon, its construction blocked access by anadromous salmonids to the upper 38 miles (48 km) of mainstem habitat and more than 30 miles (48 km) of tributary habitat.[citation needed] The salmon runs that once numbered more than 400,000 adult returns in over 70 miles (110 km) of available habitat, now number less than 4,000 adult returns on only 4.9 miles (7.9 km) of available habitat.[citation needed]\n\nThe "Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act of 1992" authorized the US Federal Government to acquire the Elwha Dam and Glines Canyon Dam hydroelectric power projects for decommissioning and demolition for habitat restoration. Work is under way on the Elwha Ecosystem Restoration project, with actual dam removal started on September 27, 2011. The dam was fully removed and the Elwha River flowed freely through the site by March 2012.\n\nSince the construction of the dams, the lower reach of the river has seen a drastic decrease in sediment delivery. This has led to a net erosion of the river bed, including the gravels needed to create suitable habitats for spawning. Replacement gravel has been trapped in the sediment load behind the dams.[3] These gravels are considered an essential resource for restoration of salmon habitats.[4] The delta at the mouth of the river, where it enters the Straits of Juan de Fuca, has also seen a net erosion effect, confirmed by local tribal leaders.[3]\n\nAnother effect of damming is the creation of Lake Aldwell and Lake Mills. These lakes have a multitude of impacts on the river beyond sediment retention. Because the water stays in the lake for so long, it warms up to approximately 16 °C.[5] Normal water temperatures are around 0 °C.[6] These higher temperatures are unnatural for spawning fish, which prefer colder ocean temperature waters. This increase in temperature also increases parasite populations.[3] Disease has been known to wipe out two thirds of a spawning population, before it has a chance to spawn.[3] The lakes also act as buffers for high and low flow conditions. While the dams are not actively used for flood control, the reservoirs behind them alter the natural flow patterns of the river. The normal seasonal high and low flow are evened out by the reservoirs and dams so that flow is relatively constant throughout the year. Natural flow patterns are known to promote the health of native species and to help eliminate non native species after dam removal.[7]\nHistory of the Elwha fishery\nRestoration prospects for various species of fish in the Elwha River. Prospects are presented for the different options and degrees of dam removal or fish bypass plans. Shows that removal of both dams results in the best prospects for all types of fish.[3]\n\nAt its peak, the Elwha supported spawning runs of Chinook, Coho, Chum, Pink, and Sockeye Salmon as well as Steelhead, Cutthroat, and Bull Trout. The Chinook were known to reach sizes of 45 kg. Sockeye, Chinook, Chum, and Pink Salmon are all currently thought to be extinct or nearly extinct in the Elwha. Leaving one or both of the dams in place, even with modern fish passage systems, would not result in a dramatic recovery of species due to other factors like water temperature, gravel beds, etc. which would still have negative effects on the fish species (see Table 1). The most valuable spawning habitats are located far upstream from the Glines Canyon dam, so it still acts as a major barrier to the recovery of the runs. Removal of the dams is thus considered the only viable option for full restoration of the river and habitat.\nDam removal\nThe dam under deconstruction, September 2011.\nThe progression of reclamation of 715 acres (2.9 km2) of vegetation habitat currently covered by the lakes. The river channel restores itself to a natural state as does the vegetation. Prior to dam removal, upstream waters are depleted in nutrients, impounded waters increase in temperature, and downstream waters are depleted in sediments and woody debris.[8]\n\nThe Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act of 1992 created funding and government support for mitigation of the dams on the Elwha. While fish ladders were proposed as a possibility, they were ultimately ruled out for the reasons above. The major problem raised with regard to removal of the two dams is the approximately 18 million cubic yards of sediment that has built up behind the dams.[9] Of that 18 million, 13 million is behind the Glines Canyon Dam, while 5 million is behind the Elwha Dam. Releasing all of this sediment at once would have devastating effects on the remaining habitats downstream from the dams, as well as along beaches at the coast. A drawdown experiment was conducted on the Glines Canyon Dam to assess the erosion of the sediments from Lake Mills.[10] The lake was drawn down 18 feet (5.5 m) over one week and then allowed to remain stable for one more week. This test showed that the river would rapidly cut into the existing delta as soon as the lake level dropped, creating a deep, narrow channel. A new delta immediately began to form at the new lake level. Once the lake level was held steady, the channel migrated laterally along the existing delta. This test resulted in a sediment erosion model in which gradual drawdown of the lake would result in a greatly decreased sediment load downstream. Using this model, the plan is to drain the lake gradually over a two year time period, allowing much of the sediment to remain in the old lake basin.\n\nAfter the two year dam removal period, the river will begin to restore itself to natural conditions. Sediment discharge rates will increase, resulting in restored and rejuvenated habitats downstream from the dams. Fish will return to the upper reaches of the Elwha as quickly as a year after dam removal is complete.[11] While the river may never return to historically large runs, after 15–20 years or more, there may be the recovery of salmon to some sort of “pre-dam” condition.[3] In addition to restoring the fish habitats, the draining of Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell will create an additional 715 acres (2.9 km2) of terrestrial vegetation, improving elk habitats as well [7] (Figure 1). Increased sediments loads are also predicted to help restore the retreating delta at the mouth of the Elwha.\nWhat remained of the dam as of February 14, 2012\n\nRemoval of the dams on the Elwha River has been a long, ongoing process. It appears now that the end is relatively near. Removal started on September 27, 2011.[12] Once the removal is complete, there is uncertainty about what exactly happens next. Because so few dam removal projects have been accompanied by scientific study, perhaps fewer than 20,[11] this project will be a model of the effectiveness of dam removal on this scale. If it is successful, there could be a movement towards the restoration of natural stream morphology through the removal of larger dams, although the results may not be apparent for some time. Most fish populations are expected to make a return to the river (Table 1). While fish may return to the river as soon as a year after the removal is complete,[11] it may take 15 to 20 years for the river to fully return to its pre-dam conditions.[3] The ultimate goal of the dam removal is restoring the river to a nearly pristine state.\n\nIt has been estimated that the removal of the dams will cost $350 million.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwha_Dam
522	162	1		Dockton is an unincorporated community in King County, Washington. It is located on Maury Island, along Quartermaster Harbor. Although once an industrial center, Dockton today is a primarily residential area, with many commuters taking the ferry to nearby Tacoma.\nHistory\n\nDockton, one of the first major settlements on the now-conjoined Vashon and Maury Islands, was an important shipbuilding center in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Puget Sound Dry Dock Company ship yard and drydock there from 1892 to 1909 was the largest on the West Coast of the United States.[1] The drydock was 325 feet (99 m) long and 203 feet (62 m) wide.[2]\n\nAfter its closure, the Stucky and Martinolich yards continued shipbuilding and repair at Dockton. Over the years a number of vessels were also built at the shipyard of John Martinolich, at Dockton on Maury Island. These included the propeller steamers Vashon (1905), Verona (1910), Nisqually (later renamed Astorian) and Calista, both built in 1911, Florence J. (1914), F.G. Reeves, (1916), Vashona (later renamed Sightseer) (1921), and the ferry Whidby (1923).[3]\n\nLaunchings did not always go well. Florence J. rolled over and sank on the first launching attempt.\n\nThe last commercial boat built at Dockton was the Janet G in 1929.[1]\n\nIn the early 1910s there was a salmon cannery at Dockton, Puget Sound fisheries peaked in 1914, but after that catches began to decline, and the cannery was closed by the end of the decade. Dockton gradually transformed into the residential community it is today.[1]\n\nAs Dockton faded as an industrial center, its situation as a residential center was improved when King County bridged the portage between Maury Island and larger Vashon Island in 1918.[1] The two islands were later connected by an artificial isthmus.\n\nThe Dockton Store, including a post office, opened in 1920. It was the center of the community until it closed in the 1980s. The building remains,[1] and is listed as a King County landmark.[4] It is the only well preserved early 20th century commercial building on Maury Island.[5]\n\nOther surviving remnants of Dockton's past are shipyard pilings, old piers and net houses, and the homes of the managers and foremen from the industrial days, known collectively as "Piano Row".[1]				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dockton,_Washington
523	5162	1		Denny Creek may be the most family-friendly trail in the region. The popular path leads to a series of waterfalls and to a smooth natural waterslide--a massive rock face over which the creek flows, providing a slippery summertime escape from the heat of the lowlands. Just beyond, hikers will find a couple more falls--most notably the beautiful Keekwulee Falls.\n\nHead up the trail as it rolls north under the high viaduct that carries I-90 traffic west. The trail crosses a creek at about 0.5 mile, then winds through the forested valley before recrossing the creek at base of the waterslide rock at about 1.3 miles.\n\nCome mid-August, you'll certainly find hikers--young and old--sporting in the cold water of Denny Creek as it slides over the granite slabs. The creek is shallow enough to be safe, but strong enough to be fun. You'll want to stick close to the kids, though, as there is a small plunge pool at the end of the slab, and the cold water can be shocking.\n\nAfter cooling off, keep moving up the trail. Just above the waterslide is a small stairstep falls, Keekwulee Falls. In another 0.5 mile (2 miles from the trailhead), is the small Snowshoe Falls. Turn around here for a 4-mile hike. Be sure to stop at the waterslide on your way out--its worth another round of water play before driving home. 			From Seattle drive east on I-90 to exit 47 (Asahel Curtis/Denny Creek). Turn left over the overpass and proceed to a T. Turn right and travel 0.25 mile to Denny Creek Road (Forest Road 58). Turn left and drive 2.5 miles, turning left on the paved road just after the Denny Creek Campground. The trailhead is at the road's end.

William Slaughter, who died in a skirmish in 1855.[21] At the time, the main hotel in town was called the "Slaughter House." In 1893, a large group of settlers from Auburn, New York, moved to Slaughter, and renamed the town to "Auburn." [3] Due to this history, when Auburn was building its second high school in the mid-1990s, there was a grass-roots effort to name the high school "Slaughter High School," but it was eventually decided that the name would be "Auburn Riverside High School," whose mascots are the Ravens.\n\nThere are several locations in Auburn on the National and State Registers of Historic Places, such as the Neely Mansion.\nNeely Mansion, Spring of 2006.\n\nThe city of Auburn, located 20 miles (32 km) south of Seattle, Washington, was home to some of the earliest settlers in King County. Nestled in a fertile river valley, Auburn has been both a farm community and a center of business and industry for more than 150 years. Auburn is located near the original confluence of the Green and White rivers, both of which contain runoff water from the Cascade Mountain range. The valley was originally the home of the Skopamish, Smalhkamish, and Stkamish Indian tribes. The first white men in the region were explorers and traders who arrived in the 1830s.\n\nSettlers first came to the valley in the 1850s. In November, a military unit led by Lieutenant William Slaughter camped near what is now present-day Auburn.\n\nA new treaty was written which provided the establishment of the Muckleshoot reservation, which is the only Indian reservation now within the boundaries of King County. The White River tribes collectively became known as the Muckleshoot tribe.\n\nWhite settlers, the Neely and Ballard families began returning to the area. In 1891, the town of Slaughter incorporated. Although many older citizens considered the town's name as a memorial, many newer residents understandably felt uncomfortable with it. Within two years, the town was renamed Auburn, taken from the first line of Oliver Goldsmith's poem, The Deserted Village: "Sweet Auburn! Loveliest village of the plain."\n\nAuburn had been a bustling center for hop farming until 1890 when the crops were destroyed by aphids. After that, the farms were mostly dairy farms and berry farms. Nevertheless, flooding was still a problem for Auburn farmers up until the Howard A. Hanson Dam was opened in 1962. This dam on the Green River, along with the Mud Mountain Dam on the White River, provided controlled river management, which left the valley nearly flood-free and opened up the rich bottom lands for industrial development.\n\nAnother impetus to Auburn's growth was the railroad. The Northern Pacific Railway's subsidiary the Northern Pacific and Puget Sound Shore Railroad opened a line from approximately Puyallup, Washington, through to Seattle, Washington, in 1882. The Seattle-Tacoma Interurban line that allowed easy access to both cities starting in 1902. The railroad, along with better roads, caused many new companies to set up business in Auburn, among them the Borden Condensery (which made Borden's Condensed Milk) and the Northern Clay Company.\n\nThrough the twentieth century Auburn grew like many American towns. The 1920s were prosperous for citizens, but the Great Depression of the 1930s left many in need. World War Two brought great hardship to many local Japanese farmers when they were moved to internment camps and their land taken from them. At the same time, local boys were sent to fight in the Pacific, and some died in battle.\n\nThe post-war era was prosperous to Auburn, bringing more businesses and a community college to the city. In 1963, the Boeing Company built a large facility to mill sheet metal skin for jet airliners. As time went on, many farms disappeared as the land was converted to industrial use. In 1995, The SuperMall of the Great Northwest was built in the valley, bringing in consumers from all over the Puget Sound region.\n\nMuch of the city's transition from agricultural small town to industrial and suburban development remains. A monument in the memory of Lieutenant Slaughter, erected in 1918, still stands in a local park. The Neely Mansion, built by the son of a pioneer in 1891, has been refurbished and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Auburn's downtown still maintains a "Main Street U.S.A." appearance.\nDowntown redevelopment\nLooking down towards Auburn Way from West Main street.\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s Auburn's downtown began a slow decline in business and travel. A 2001 citizens plan gathered ideals and realizations of the citizens of Auburn and what they wanted in downtown, after several years development has begun. In 2008, construction began of a new 300 hundred stall, 97,000-square-foot (9,000 m2) parking garage and medical building for the Auburn Regional Medical Center, located directly north of city hall.[22]\n\nWith the garage now being built, now parking opportunity have allowed city code to continue with the re-development of the downtown core. In 2009 a city annex and a Key Bank Branch anchored to the east will sit on the current site of the abandoned tavern row.[22]\n\nWith the main project goal of encompassing a regional entertainment and shopping center, while being an Urban Center. The “Auburn Junction” will complete that goal. Proposed and adopted by the city council Alpert International will begin construction in 2010, with 750,000 square feet (70,000 m2), and a price tag of $240,000,000, the Junction will include retail below and high density apartments/condos above.[23] An AMC theatre and traditional court yard will be included. It will cover the main block on the former Cavanaugh Hardware site.\n\nIn addition to the Auburn Junction, the Stratford company will construct a 200-unit mixed use development called Auburn Station I and II, set for construction in late 2009. It will be located in the heart of downtown adjacent to the Auburn Sounder Station With the redevelopment occurring at fast rate, projections are that downtown in the next 15 years will once again become vital and vibrant while enticing all, throughout the lower Puget Sound area.[24]\nRecreation and entertainment\nThe SuperMall of the Great Northwest\nMain article: SuperMall of the Great Northwest\n\nThe Supermall, which opened in August, 1995, is often considered to be the largest outlet mall in South King county. Located at the Southeast corner of the junction between SR 167 and SR 18, the mall is strategically placed, for ease of access. Anchor tenants who occupy lease space in the mall include:\n\n    Old Navy\n    Bed Bath and Beyond\n    Burlington Coat Factory\n    Marshalls\n    Nordstrom Rack\n\nSurrounding the mall is a local Wal-Mart, a Regal Theater with seventeen screens, the Boeing plant of Auburn, and various other commercial businesses. The nearby recently-constructed Safeway distribution center was featured in the Modern Marvels episode "Supermarkets."\nMuckleshoot Casino & Bingo\nSee also: Muckleshoot\n\nMuckleshoot Casino & Bingo, commonly known for its slogan, "The Biggest and Best in the Northwest!" is an Indian-run casino, located on the Muckleshoot Reservation.[4] In addition to being one of the largest casinos in the Pacific Northwest, it is one of the few left in the state that allows smoking. All money made in the casino directly benefits the Muckleshoot Tribal Community, providing education and low-cost health care for tribal residents.\nEmerald Downs Racetrack\nMain article: Emerald Downs\n\nWashington’s only Class One thoroughbred racetrack.

The site also houses the River Lodge (a 6,000-square-foot (560 m2) lounge), the Bear and Wolf Houses (all ages cafes), and four separate restroom buildings.\nWhite River Valley Museum\n\nThe White River Valley Museum’s exhibits tell the story of Auburn, from Native American history to the 1920s. They focus on the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, pioneer life, immigration from Europe and Japan, truck farming, railroading and the building of towns throughout the area. Visitors get to wander into a pioneer cabin, climb aboard a Northern Pacific Railway caboose, and investigate the shops in 1924 downtown Auburn.[25]\nAuburn Junior Football\n\nAuburn Junior Football or AJF is a Little league Football team that consists of Pee Wee, Midgets, 89ers, Bantams and Sweet Peas.

526	5309	1		Discovery Park is a 534 acre (2.2 km²) park in the Magnolia neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. It is the city's largest public park and contains 11.81 miles of walking trails. United Indians of All Tribes' Daybreak Star Cultural Center is within the park's boundaries. On the south side of the North Beach strip is a sewage treatment plant, but it is almost entirely concealed from the marsh, beach and trail.\n\nThe park is built on the historic grounds of Fort Lawton; most of the Fort Lawton Historic District (FLHD) falls within the park (although an enclave within the district remains in military hands), as does the West Point Lighthouse. Both the FLHD and the lighthouse are on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe park is one of the best places in the city to view wildlife, especially birds[1] and marine mammals.[2] The Seattle Audubon Society has compiled a checklist of 270 species of birds seen in the park and nearby waters.[3] Elliott and Shilshole Bays are home to harbor seals and California sea lions, while the wooded areas support Townsend's chipmunks. Most visitors enjoy hiking the Loop Trail, which forms a circuit through forest, meadow, and shrub habitats around the upland portion of the park, and provides excellent views of Puget Sound. The shoreline is accessible by road or trail (the hike back up from the north beach is mildly strenuous), however, a permit is required prior to driving a vehicle to the beach. Free permits can be obtained at the Environmental Learning Center in the East Parking Lot and are designated for qualified individuals only (groups with children 7 and under, seniors 62+, and people with a physical disability). The south beach is on the windward side of the peninsula, Elliott Bay, and the north beach is on the leeward side and has views of Shilshole Bay. At the point between the north and south beaches is West Point and the West Point Lighthouse. Coniferous forest is mostly to be found in the north bluff region and can be accessed from the road that leads to the beach. Deciduous woods surround the two parking lots and the visitor center. Overlooking the south bluff is a large meadow with small trees and shrubs. Bigleaf maple, red alder, bitter cherry, Douglas-fir, western red cedar, and western hemlock make up a large percentage of the tree cover in the park.[4] Invasive species such as Himalayan blackberry, Scot's broom, English Ivy, and Holly are present throughout, requiring active on-going management to suppress.[5]\nHistory\nDaybreak Star Cultural Center\n\nDiscovery Park is a relatively recent creation, having been created in the early 1970s from land surplus to the U.S. Army's Fort Lawton. The site for the 1,100 acre (4.5 km²) fort had been given to the Army by the city in 1898, and the fort opened in 1900. The Army offered to sell it back to the city for one dollar in 1938 but the city refused, citing maintenance concerns. Much of the land was surplused in 1971, given to the city in 1972, and dedicated as Discovery Park in 1973. Fort Lawton still exists within the park as headquarters of the U.S. Army Reserve's 70th Regional Readiness Command and a military housing site. Grunge band Temple of the Dog filmed the music video for their hit single "Hunger Strike" on the shores of Discovery Park.\nIssues\nWest Point Lighthouse\n\nThe most controversial issue regarding the Discovery Park is what to do with former military property acquired in and around the park. In 2004, the City of Seattle announced it would purchase 23 (later 24) acres of U.S. Navy property within the park. The decision was ultimately made to demolish the structures to create open space.[6] In 2008, plans to close Army base Fort Lawton opened up debate over what to do with the former military properties: housing advocates wanted it converted into affordable housing, while some neighborhood groups opposed the idea.[7] The City Council approved building up to 216 housing units, leading to a lawsuit.[8] As of March 2009, the King County Superior Court Judge ordered the city to comply with the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) process.[9]\n\nIn 2008 a group of homeless people and homeless rights advocates set up camp in the park, but was forced to vacate by the city.[10]\n\nIn September 2010, the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development approved the 10 October 2008 Proposed Redevelopment Plan and Homeless Assistance Application for the US Army Ft. Lawton Complex. The HUD letter to the mayor of Seattle stated the need for homeless housing outweighed the need for other redevelopment proposals and that 144 family housing units and over 2000 beds in "supportive" permanent housing should be built and that HUD was ready to assist the city of Seattle, if required.[11]\n\nThe park has a remarkable tendency to attract wild animals. In the winter of 2008-2009, a coyote in the park made headlines,[12] and in May 2009, a black bear was seen.[13] In September 2009, the park was closed because of the presence of a cougar. The animal was trapped and transported to the Cascade mountains.[14]\n\nThe beach has a history of sporadic clothing-optional use in the more remote areas of its shoreline. However, such use is currently not officially sanctioned by the City. A beach rally organized by The Body Freedom Collaborative's Seattle Free Beach Campaign[15] on September 4, 2004 to shore support for clothing-optional use resulted in the arrest of a man sunbathing, after a complaint was made to the Seattle Police.[16]				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Park_%28Seattle%29
527	624	1		Cambridge is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States, in the Greater Boston area. It was named in honor of the University of Cambridge in England, an important center of the Puritan theology embraced by the town's founders.[1] Cambridge is home to two of the world's most prominent universities, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city's population was 105,162.[2] It is the fifth most populous city in the state, behind Boston, Worcester, Springfield, and Lowell.[2] Cambridge is one of the two county seats of Middlesex County (Lowell is the other).\n\nA resident of Cambridge is known as a Cantabrigian.[3]\n\nThe site for what would become Cambridge was chosen in December 1630, because it was located safely up river from Boston Harbor, which made it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships. Also, the water from the local spring was so good that the local Native Americans believed it had medicinal properties.[citation needed] The first houses were built in the spring of 1631. The settlement was initially referred to as "the newe towne".[4] Official Massachusetts records show the name capitalized as Newe Towne by 1632.[5] Located at the first convenient Charles River crossing west of Boston, Newe Towne was one of a number of towns (including Boston, Dorchester, Watertown, and Weymouth) founded by the 700 original Puritan colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Colony under governor John Winthrop. The original village site is in the heart of today's Harvard Square. The marketplace where farmers brought in crops from surrounding towns to sell survives today as the small park at the corner of John F. Kennedy (J.F.K.) and Winthrop Streets, then at the edge of a salt marsh, since filled. The town included a much larger area than the present city, with various outlying parts becoming independent towns over the years: Newton (originally Cambridge Village, then Newtown) in 1688,[6] Lexington (Cambridge Farms) in 1712, and both West Cambridge (originally Menotomy) and Brighton (Little Cambridge) in 1807.[7] Part of West Cambridge joined the new town of Belmont in 1859, and the rest of West Cambridge was renamed Arlington in 1867; Brighton was annexed by Boston in 1874. In the late 19th century, various schemes for annexing Cambridge itself to the City of Boston were pursued and rejected.[8][9]\n\nIn 1636, Harvard College was founded by the colony to train ministers and the new town was chosen for its site by Thomas Dudley. By 1638, the name "Newe Towne" had "compacted by usage into 'Newtowne'."[4] In May 1638[10][11] the name was changed to Cambridge in honor of the university in Cambridge, England.[12] The first president (Henry Dunster), the first benefactor (John Harvard), and the first schoolmaster (Nathaniel Eaton) of Harvard were all Cambridge University alumni, as was the then ruling (and first) governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, John Winthrop. In 1629, Winthrop had led the signing of the founding document of the city of Boston, which was known as the Cambridge Agreement, after the university.[13] It was Governor Thomas Dudley who, in 1650, signed the charter creating the corporation which still governs Harvard College.[14][15]\nGeorge Washington in Cambridge, 1775\n\nCambridge grew slowly as an agricultural village eight miles (13 km) by road from Boston, the capital of the colony. By the American Revolution, most residents lived near the Common and Harvard College, with farms and estates comprising most of the town. Most of the inhabitants were descendants of the original Puritan colonists, but there was also a small elite of Anglican "worthies" who were not involved in village life, who made their livings from estates, investments, and trade, and lived in mansions along "the Road to Watertown" (today's Brattle Street, still known as Tory Row). In 1775, George Washington came up from Virginia to take command of fledgling volunteer American soldiers camped on the Cambridge Common—today called the birthplace of the U.S. Army. (The name of today's nearby Sheraton Commander Hotel refers to that event.) Most of the Tory estates were confiscated after the Revolution. On January 24, 1776, Henry Knox arrived with artillery captured from Fort Ticonderoga, which enabled Washington to drive the British army out of Boston.\nA map of Cambridge from 1873.\n\nBetween 1790 and 1840, Cambridge began to grow rapidly, with the construction of the West Boston Bridge in 1792, that connected Cambridge directly to Boston, making it no longer necessary to travel eight miles (13 km) through the Boston Neck, Roxbury, and Brookline to cross the Charles River. A second bridge, the Canal Bridge, opened in 1809 alongside the new Middlesex Canal. The new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and marshland into prime industrial and residential districts.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Cambridge was the center of a literary revolution when it gave the country a new identity through poetry and literature. Cambridge was home to the famous Fireside Poets—so called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires. In their day, the Fireside Poets—Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes—were as popular and influential as rock stars are today.[citation needed]\n\nSoon after, turnpikes were built: the Cambridge and Concord Turnpike (today's Broadway and Concord Ave.), the Middlesex Turnpike (Hampshire St. and Massachusetts Ave. northwest of Porter Square), and what are today's Cambridge, Main, and Harvard Streets were roads to connect various areas of Cambridge to the bridges. In addition, railroads crisscrossed the town during the same era, leading to the development of Porter Square as well as the creation of neighboring town Somerville from the formerly rural parts of Charlestown.\n1852 Map of Boston area showing Cambridge and rail lines.\n\nCambridge was incorporated as a city in 1846. This was despite noticeable tensions between East Cambridge, Cambridgeport, and Old Cambridge that stemmed from differences in in each area's culture, sources of income, and the national origins of the residents.[16] The city's commercial center began to shift from Harvard Square to Central Square, which became the downtown of the city around this time. Between 1850 and 1900, Cambridge took on much of its present character—streetcar suburban development along the turnpikes, with working-class and industrial neighborhoods focused on East Cambridge, comfortable middle-class housing being built on old estates in Cambridgeport and Mid-Cambridge, and upper-class enclaves near Harvard University and on the minor hills of the city. The coming of the railroad to North Cambridge and Northwest Cambridge then led to three major changes in the city: the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between Massachusetts Ave., Concord Ave. and Alewife Brook; the ice-cutting industry launched by Frederic Tudor on Fresh Pond; and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to provide housing to the thousands of immigrants that arrived to work in the new industries.\n\nFor many years, the city's largest employer was the New England Glass Company, founded in 1818. By the middle of the 19th century it was the largest and most modern glassworks in the world. In 1888, all production was moved, by Edward Drummond Libbey, to Toledo, Ohio, where it continues today under the name Owens Illinois. Flint glassware with heavy lead content, produced by that company, is prized by antique glass collectors. There is none on public display in Cambridge, but there is a large collection in the Toledo Museum of Art.\n\nAmong the largest businesses located in Cambridge was the firm of Carter's Ink Company, whose neon sign long adorned the Charles River and which was for many years the largest manufacturer of ink in the world.\n\nBy 1920, Cambridge was one of the main industrial cities of New England, with nearly 120,000 residents. As industry in New England began to decline during the Great Depression and after World War II, Cambridge lost much of its industrial base. It also began the transition to being an intellectual, rather than an industrial, center. Harvard University had always been important in the city (both as a landowner and as an institution), but it began to play a more dominant role in the city's life and culture. Also, the move of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from Boston in 1916 ensured Cambridge's status as an intellectual center of the United States.\n\nAfter the 1950s, the city's population began to decline slowly, as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples. The 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups, creating software such as Visicalc and Lotus 1-2-3, and advanced computers, but many of these companies fell into decline with the fall of the minicomputer and DOS-based systems. However, the city continues to be home to many startups as well as a thriving biotech industry. By the end of the 20th century, Cambridge had one of the most expensive housing markets in the Northeastern United States.\n\nWhile maintaining much diversity in class, race, and age, it became harder and harder for those who grew up in the city to be able to afford to stay. The end of rent control in 1994 prompted many Cambridge renters to move to housing that was more affordable, in Somerville and other communities. In 2005, a reassessment of residential property values resulted in a disproportionate number of houses owned by non-affluent people jumping in value relative to other houses, with hundreds having their property tax increased by over 100%; this forced many homeowners in Cambridge to move elsewhere.[17]\n\nAs of 2012, Cambridge's mix of amenities and proximity to Boston has kept housing prices relatively stable.\n\nParks and outdoors\nAlewife Brook Reservation\n\nConsisting largely of densely built residential space, Cambridge lacks significant tracts of public parkland. This is partly compensated for, however, by the presence of easily accessible open space on the university campuses, including Harvard Yard and MIT's Great Lawn, as well as the considerable open space of Mount Auburn Cemetery. At the western edge of Cambridge, the cemetery is well known as the first garden cemetery, for its distinguished inhabitants, for its superb landscaping (the oldest planned landscape in the country), and as a first-rate arboretum. Although known as a Cambridge landmark, much of the cemetery lies within the bounds of Watertown.[20] It is also a significant Important Bird Area (IBA) in the Greater Boston area.\n\nPublic parkland includes the esplanade along the Charles River, which mirrors its Boston counterpart, Cambridge Common, a busy and historic public park immediately adjacent to the Harvard campus, and the Alewife Brook Reservation and Fresh Pond in the western part of the city.\n\n				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts

The Lummi Indian Reservation is situated on a peninsula east of the island, but does not include Lummi Island. The island has a land area of 23.97 km² (9.255 sq mi) and had a population of 822 as of the 2000 census. The population nearly doubles in summer when property owners from both Canada and the U. S. arrive for summer fun and relaxation. The island is accessible by a 22 car ferry, the Whatcom Chief run by Whatcom County Public Works.[1] It is 6 minute passage from Gooseberry point on the mainland to the island. On the island there is one general store, two restaurants, several bed and breakfasts, a small library, post office, fire station, one church, a Boys & Girls club, a Salvation Army camp, and a vintage 1919 elementary school. The Beach Store Cafe is a popular local hangout with a small bar and serves seafood and traditional cafe fare. The Willows Inn serves more expensive fare with seasonal treats from island farms and fishers. The historic Lummi Island Congregational Church sets next to its quiet, wooded cemetery. Lummi Island is best known for its unique reefnet salmon fishery, eclectic population of artists, picturesque seascapes and rural setting. Its narrow, scenic and winding roads are popular with bicyclers. A trail to Lummi Mountain takes hikers through the Baker Preserve to stunning high views of the San Juan and Gulf Islands. The trail is maintained by the Lummi Island Heritage Trust.\n\nThe island was originally called Sa nam a o ("High Mountain")[2] and Skallaham by the native Indians. In 1792 Spanish explorers dubbed it Isla de Pacheco, and it was later known as McLoughlin Island. In 1853, the U.S. National Geodetic Survey charted the island as Lummi, naming it after the tribe. It is believed the name comes from luminara, referring to the bonfires the Spanish saw upon arrival and whence the tribe also took their name,[3] though there are also theories that it is derived from a native word or phrase.[2]\nEvents\n\nThe island hosts a weekly farmers' market in the spring and summer, a chili festival in mid-July, and a Christmas party for island children.\n\nLummi Island is also home to a large number of artists who conduct studio tours on Memorial Day, Labor Day, and the first weekend of December.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lummi_Island
529	5248	1		A minimum impact nature area, Shark Reef Sanctuary provides a great opportunity to view wildlife in this relatively untouched parcel of land. Named after a nearby reef, the sanctuary is home to native sea birds as well as seals and other marine life. If you’re going to visit a park on Lopez, Shark Reef should be your first destination not just for the wildlife but also for the impressive view.\n\nA country road leads to the park entrance and primitive trails wind through the woods to the sound. Both the trail and the park are relatively primitive--bikes, camping and fires are not permitted. The path through the park is not passable in a wheelchair, with many roots and logs crisscrossing the route. A brief, 15-minute walk will bring you to the main attraction of the park, the rocky cliffs overlooking the water.\n\nFrom here, visitors look out on a sweeping view of San Juan Channel between Lopez and San Juan Islands. On a clear day, the Olympics are clearly visible to the southwest. Some scrambling down the rocks takes you to the water and the kelp beds, rock formations, and tide pools which are prime for exploration. Your best bet is to time your visit with an ebb tide; the current flows rather quickly along the cliffs on the tide change.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of a visit to Shark Reef is watching the seals from the cliffs. A well-worn path leads south to a spot parallel to some offshore rock piles. Throughout the year, seals lounge on the rocks and cavort in the surrounding slow waters. They can usually be seen with the naked eye but binoculars help. The best time to see the seals is between tides, when the turbulent waters of the channel move much slower. If you’re lucky, you’ll see the seals crossing the channel to swim within a few feet of onlookers.\nWritten By: Glen Berry\nOn: 10/4/2000\n			Address\nShark Reef Road\nLopez Island , WA 98261\nHours\nEvery day Dawn - Dusk\n	http://sanjuanislands.kulshan.com/Washington/San%20Juan%20County/Lopez%20Island/Lopez%20Island/Outdoors/Shark%20Reef%20Sanctuary.htm
530	5282	1		A diversity of landscape and ecosystems are found along this canyon trek. Starting high and hiking downhill, the route begins in open, Douglas fir forest and ends in sagebrush and scrub grass desert canyons.\n\nElk roam the upper woods, and bighorn sheep prowl the steep canyon walls around the pounding waterfall. Visit in early spring to enjoy the best wildlife viewing (beasts of all sizes stick to this canyon while the snows still fill the high country). Spring also means the waterfall is running full with snowmelt water. The area in and around the falls is very icy in winter.\n\nFrom the parking area, start down the Umtanum Falls Trail, noting that the first 0.5 mile no longer rolls between sections of private property. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife purchased this land in 2006, and it is now part of the state-owned L. T. Murray State Wildlife Recreation Area lands. For the next 0.5 mile, you'll pass through the transition zone between the lowland forest and the high desert. At times the canyon narrows and the north wall looms higher. With more shade and less scorching sun in the summer, trees thrive. Douglas firs tower high on the shaded slopes, while the canyon floor sports a dense forest of pine and fir. As you near the 1-mile mark, the canyon walls mellow, opening the entire chasm to the full glare of sun day in and day out. The result is dramatic: Gone are the towering firs and pines, and instead the canyon is filled with fragrant sagebrush groves.\n\nAt just over 1 mile, the stunning punchbowl surrounding Umtanum Falls opens before you. The creek falls about 40 feet into an oval-shaped basalt bowl. Throughout winter and spring, ice plasters the black rock alongside the falls as the water cascades into the bowl and then out a narrow canyon. In this water-rich basin, ponderosa pines thrive.\n\nHikers may continue down the creek valley for several miles along the "official" trail (brushy scramble in places), though we recommend exploring. Rock-hop across the creek well above the falls, where you'll find an easily scrambled slope to the top of the south wall of the canyon. Follow the canyon rim to view amazing rock formations: myriad volcanic basalt forms that boggle the mind. Later in spring, the ridge top also sports the first color of the local wildflower show. Buckwheat and balsamroot are especially abundant.\n\nFor a good daylong outing, follow the south canyon rim about 3 miles until it is broken by a broad side canyon, then turn back and head home. 			From Seattle, drive east on Interstate 90 to exit 109 in Ellensburg. At the end of the exit ramp, turn right to drive under the freeway and at 0.7 mile turn left at Umtanum Road at the traffic light. Stay on this road, which turns to gravel at 5.2 miles, for a total of 10 miles from the freeway exit. At 10 miles, find a small signed parking area at a sharp turn in the road. Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife permit required.	http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/umtanum-creek-falls
531	2507	1		Yakima County is the second largest county by area in the U.S. state of Washington. It is named after the Yakama tribe of Native Americans. In the 2010 census, its population was 243,231.[1] The county seat is Yakima, which is also its largest city.\n\nThe Yakama Indian Reservation, the 15th largest reservation in America, covers 1,573 mi² (4,074 km²),[2] comprising 36% of the county's total area. Its population was 31,799 in 2000, and its largest city is Toppenish.\n\nYakima County was formed out of Ferguson County on January 21, 1865. Ferguson County, no longer in existence, had been created from Walla Walla County on January 23, 1863.[3]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 4,312 square miles (11,170 km2), of which 4,296 square miles (11,130 km2) is land and 15 square miles (39 km2) (0.36%) is water. Yakima County is the second largest county in Washington by area. Yakima County is also widely known for being one of the most difficult places on earth to predict weather, because of the mountains that surround it. The total area covered by the county is larger than the states of Delaware and Rhode Island combined.[4] The highest point in the county is Mount Adams, which is the second tallest peak in Washington and the third tallest in the entire Cascade Range.\nGeographic features\nMount Adams, highest point in Yakima County\n\n    Mount Adams, 12,281 feet (3,743 m)\n    Gilbert Peak, 8,184 feet (2,494 m)\n    Mount Aix, 7,766 feet (2,367 m)\n    Tieton Peak, 7,724 feet (2,354 m)\n    Cascade Mountains\n    Rattlesnake Hills\n    Horse Heaven Hills\n\nMajor rivers\n\n    Yakima River\n    Columbia River\n    Naches River\n    Tieton River\n    Bumping River\n    American River\n\nNational protected areas\n\n    Wenatchee National Forest (part)\n    Gifford Pinchot National Forest (part)\n    Snoqualmie National Forest (part)\n\n\t\n\n    Goat Rocks Wilderness\n    Mount Adams Wilderness (part)\n    Norse Peak Wilderness (part)\n    William O.

534	5222	1		Federal Way is a city in King County, Washington, United States. Federal Way is located between Seattle and Tacoma. Its western boundary is Puget Sound. It is bordered by Des Moines on the north, Kent, unincorporated King County, and Milton on the east and Tacoma and Fife on the south. The population was 89,306 in 2010 Census.\n\nOriginally a logging settlement, the area was first called "Federal Way" in 1929, when Federal Way School District #210 was created.[5] The name derived from Federal Highway U.S. 99 (now State Route 99 or Pacific Highway South), completed that decade, which ran through the area on its way from Everett and Seattle to Tacoma.[5] Federal Way High School opened in 1930, and the local Chamber of Commerce adopted the name in the early 1950s.[6] The city was incorporated on February 28, 1990.[6]\nCommerce and attractions\n\nFederal Way is home to Weyerhaeuser, the largest private owner of softwood timberland in the world. Weyerhaeuser has opened much of its land to the public, including two botanical gardens: the Rhododendron Species Foundation and Botanical Garden, and the Pacific Rim Bonsai Collection. Federal Way is also home to the US office headquarters of World Vision.\n\nOther attractions in the city include the Weyerhaeuser King County Aquatic Center, which features an Olympic size swimming pool and had been used for the 1990 Goodwill Games, and Celebration Park, with sports fields and wooded trails. The city has also developed many lake front and neighborhood parks and playgrounds.\n\nWild Waves Theme Park, the largest amusement park in the region, is known as Wild Waves and Enchanted Village. It is located on the south side of the city and is the Seattle area's only permanent amusement park. Six Flags purchased Wild Waves in December 2000. However after low sales, Six Flags sold the park in April 2007 to Parc Management LLC of Jacksonville, Fl for $31.75 million.\n\nFederal Way is locally identified by its 1990s semi-urban development, characterized by landscaped off-street multi-structure apartment complexes and shopping centers. The Commons at Federal Way (previously Sea Tac Mall), the city's only indoor shopping center, is located on S 320th St. and Pacific Hwy South (State Route 99) near the city's main Interstate 5 exit.\n\nMajor city and state parks:\n\n    Steel Lake Park – located on S 312th St just east of Pacific Hwy S; large lakefront area with picnic areas, playground, and boat launch.\n    Celebration Park – on 11th Ave S just south of S 324th St; with sports fields and wooded trails, and Independence Day fireworks.\n    Dash Point State Park – on SW Dast Point Rd at the west end of town; the city's only developed waterfront park, with hiking trails and campground.[7]\n    Five Mile Lake – on Military Rd S and S 364th St in the unincorporated area on the east side of town.\n    West Hylebos Wetlands Park – at S 348th St and 4th Ave S, hiking trails through wetlands.[8]\n    The BPA Trail extending from the entrance to Celebration Park west to approximately 18th Ave SW, then south to the Pierce County border. The trail is paved and lies under the Bonneville Power Administration transmission line.\n\nDowntown tower projects\n\nIn 2007, the city of Federal Way purchased a downtown lot formerly used by a defunct AMC Theatres cinema, and invited proposals from two developers, United Properties and Alpert Capital, to develop a multi-use tower project in the downtown core, adjacent to the recently-built transit center. Such a project follows in the steps of similar multi-use developments such as Kent Station in nearby Kent. The city awarded the contract to United Properties' "Symphony" project, comprising four 15–22 story towers including 60,000 square feet (5,600 m2) of retail and office space, 900 housing units, and a large downtown park which would be relinquished to the city. Transfer of the land to United Properties followed by construction of the first tower was scheduled to start in mid-[2008].[9] However, in July 2008, United Properties' requested a one-year extension on the terms of the purchase agreement, citing difficulties in the credit and housing markets to acquire the necessary funds.[10] In August 2009, United suggested scrapping the Symphony plan and instead building a performing arts center on the property, a proposal the city rejected.[11]\n\nIn September 2009 the South Korean development firm Lander Korus joined onto the project with United.[12] Korus proposed adding Asian elements to the building in order to attract investment and interest from the city's influential Korean population and foreign investment. However, by July 2010, after having granted United and Korus five extensions to close on the project, the city transferred the deal to another Korean developer, Twin Development,[13] which had planned a similar project on another lot. The new developer brings a new design, with two 45-story and one 35-story mixed-use towers. As of 2011 the new developers have yet to close on the property, citing financing difficulties and have received the seventh extension on the land from the city, which expires in March 2011.[14] The developers are banking on the city's recently granted EB-5 visa qualification to encourage foreign investment in exchange for permanent resident status.[15] As of February 1, 2011, this deal is also dead, as the developer failed to make a required escrow deposit by the end of January.[16]\n\nIn 2011 the city renewed its Request For Quotes for the undeveloped site, and received three proposals. The city ultimately chose a proposal by Arcadd known as the "Crystal Palace", a densely-packed glass multi-tower structure where some of the towers bend outward near the top under 20 stories with a larger retail and public space pavilion at the base.[17]\nGovernment\n\nThe Federal Way City Council consists of seven at-large seats who serve for staggered two-year terms. The city mayor acts as chair of the Council and is elected by the Council from among its members. In November 2009, the citizens of Federal Way approved Proposition 1 Led by City Council Member Jim Ferrell, 52%–48% to change the form of government from a City Manager-Council run government to a strong elected Mayor-Council government. Federal Way voters elected former mayor and state representative Skip Priest as mayor on Nov. 2, 2010.\nGrowth\n\nAs part of the Washington State Growth Management Act of 1990 (GMA), Federal Way, along with other Puget Sound suburban cities have identified Potential Annexation Area's (PAA's) as areas of unincorporated King County that they feel could best be serviced by them. Federal Way has indicated interest in West Hill (east of the city to the Auburn city limits), Lakeland (south and east of the city to the King/Pierce County border and east to the Auburn city limits), and Star Lake (north and east of the city to the Kent city limits). In 2004, the city annexed the Northlake, East Redondo, and Parkway neighborhoods into the city, adding over 2,700 people and nearly 1 square mile (2.57 km²) of area. Other possible annexation areas include the Jovita and Camelot neighborhoods.\n\nIn February 2007, the city announced formal plans to annex the majority of unincorporated land on its east border as one PAA named East Federal Way, comprising the Star Lake, Camelot, Lakeland, and Jovita neighborhoods,[18][19] and a strip of road connecting them. Annexation of the area would add 20,000 people and nearly 7 sq. mi (18 km²) to the city, creating the 6th largest city in Washington by population, at over 106,000 residents and nearly 29 sq mi (75 km2). (75 km²)[20]\n\nOn August 21, 2007, residents of the proposed East Federal Way annexation area rejected annexation to Federal Way by a 66% to 34% margin.[21] Opponents of the plan, favoring remaining under direct King County government, asserted fears that increased density and higher taxes would result from annexation despite proponents showing studies that taxes and fees would be unchanged.[22]\n\nIn 2011 a movement was underway to organize the unincorporated area as a township, a municipal structure that does not currently exist anywhere else in the state but which the state constitution provides for. If successful, a township organization would prevent the involuntary annexation of the area.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Way,_Washington
535	5372	1		State Route 522 (SR 522) connects Seattle to its northeastern suburbs. Its southern origin is at Interstate 5 at the north end of the Roosevelt neighborhood in north Seattle, where it is a city arterial, Lake City Way N.E. Upon crossing the Seattle city limits into Lake Forest Park, its name changes to Bothell Way N.E. It continues through Kenmore and into Bothell, where part of it is designated Woodinville Drive. East of downtown Bothell, SR 522 becomes a freeway as the first segment of the Bothell-Monroe Highway. It continues through Woodinville to an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road. From there, it continues east as a two-lane freeway into unincorporated Snohomish County to Monroe, where it ends at the junction with U.S. Route 2. It is about 25 miles (40 km) long in total.\n\nOnce called the Red Brick Road, SR 522 originally connected Downtown Seattle to the towns of Lake City, Lake Forest Park, Kenmore, Bothell, Redmond, Falls City and points east. Rebuilt and expanded after World War II, it remained a connector from downtown Seattle through to Redmond until the construction of Interstate 5, when its origination point moved several miles north along that freeway into the Roosevelt neighborhood of Seattle.\n\nAfter 1970, the easternmost portion of SR 522 from Bothell to Woodinville, Redmond, and North Bend was renumbered as State Route 202, and the portion of what had been SR 202 between Bothell and Monroe was renumbered as SR 522. A highly-utilized bypass to reach Stevens Pass, 1,780 accidents, 1,359 injuries, and 47 deaths in 15 years resulted in the highway being included in the September 1995 Reader's Digest article "America's Most Dangerous Highways." The route has also been featured in a Dateline NBC story and a 2007 Forbes Magazine[2] article for similar reasons.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Route_522
536	5373	1		Pocahontas State Park at 7,950 acres is the largest Virginia State Park.\nBuilt by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), this was the first recreational park in the Richmond-Petersburg-Hopewell area. The National Park Service donated the facility to Virginia State Parks in 1946, making it the largest Virginia state park with more than 7,950 acres and two small lakes. The area was renamed Pocahontas State Park and Pocahontas State Forest and was operated under a cooperative management arrangement with the Department of Forestry. In 1989 a new master plan, funded jointly by the Commonwealth of Virginia and Chesterfield County, called for expansion of park facilities to accommodate the large urban population surrounding the park. Today the entire area is operated as Pocahontas State Park. It has yellow poplar, red maple, Loblolly pine, & Black oak forests.				
537	4522	1		Kootenai County is a county located in the U.S. state of Idaho. The county was established in 1864, named after Kootenai tribe. The entire county comprises the Coeur d'Alene, Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 138,494 at the 2010 census.[1] The county seat and largest city is Coeur d'Alene.[2]\n\nDirectly west across the state border is the Spokane, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area, comprising Spokane County, Washington; the combined population of the two counties was estimated at 608,074 in 2009.\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of 1,315.69 square miles (3,407.6 km2), of which 1,245.12 square miles (3,224.8 km2) (or 94.64%) is land and 70.57 square miles (182.8 km2) (or 5.36%) is water.[4] The vast majority of the water area is the county's primary attraction, Lake Coeur d'Alene. Kootenai County is part of the Inland Empire in the Idaho Panhandle.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kootenai_County,_Idaho

Holding to the truth and teachings of the Bible — we practice unity, believe in diversity and invest in mission. Our gatherings draw a diverse cross-section of people who celebrate the freedom of Christ as we seek to restore the purity and grace of New Testament Christianity.				http://nwchurch.net/web/
541	5425	1		Calvary Chapel could best be described as an affiliation of churches that offer a balanced approach to church life. We believe that the church should be centered around and based completely on the word of God. Learning God's word is extremely important to Calvary Chapel churches and our plan is to study the Bible, book by book, chapter by chapter, verse by verse until we have studied the Bible in its entirety, both Old and New Testaments. We believe it is important to know the "whole counsel of God" Acts 20:27. Our weekly studies are not topical but are instead journeys through the scriptures that begin each week where we ended the week previous.\n\nWe also believe that a healthy church is a church that is filled with the Holy Spirit. We believe that the gifts of the Holy Spirit are for today's church and we desire to have an open heart and a Biblical perspective to the leading of the Holy Spirit and the exercising of these gifts. Worship is extremely important to a church and we desire to have Spirit-filled, powerful, contemporary worship that will bless the Lord and our people.\n\nWe believe that the book of Acts has the best model in which to pattern a church. Acts 2:42 says "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer". We desire to have all of these aspects, important to the early church, be the pillars of City Calvary. A church needs to be a community where people can come and be a part of something, where they can grow in their relationship with Jesus and develop solid friendships with those in the body of Christ. We look to our Lord to bring growth to our church body. It says in Acts 2:47 "And the Lord added to their numbers daily those who were being saved." He has been faithful to do this at CCC since our formation.\n\nIn addition, we take the Great Commission seriously and we desire to see the Gospel of Jesus spread throughout the Puget Sound region and to the ends of the earth. CCC has had the blessing of planting two churches in Russia (Smolensk & Ryazan) and has sent other missionaries to other locations all around the world, from Indonesia to Belfast, Northern Ireland. We also seek to reach those in the Seattle area as well.\n\nCity Calvary has a diverse congregation and it is our desire to be led by God and to offer ministries and gatherings that will bless all of our people, kids, teens and adults alike. Please look through our various ministries to see what is offered. Thanks for visiting our website and feel free to call the church office if you have any questions. 				http://www.citycalvarychapel.org/about

543	4103	1		Mason County’s Lost Lake covers 122 surface acres, reaches a maximum depth of 65 feet and is at an elevation of 480 feet. It is a clear water lake with little surface aquatic vegetation. Some bottom vegetation will hang up on worms and jigs while fishing for bass.\n\nPublic access for Lost Lake is provided by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. It is a very large access area with more than adequate parking space. The access also provides a very good concrete plank boat launching ramp with just the right slope and a newer concrete vault toilet. Access rules are posted at the launch area and include, "No camping or overnight Parking," "No swimming," No interference with boat launching and retrieval," and "No interference with anglers fishing from shoreline." It also has a "No parking beyond this sign" which keeps inconsiderate parkers from parking in the tow vehicle lane and making it difficult to launch.\n\nThe shoreline has lots of shoreline homes with private docks and floats. These docks and floats provide shade and ambush points for the largemouth bass and great casting targets for bass anglers. Some areas of the shoreline have lots of overhanging trees and logs in the water. These areas also provide excellent habitat for the largemouth bass.\n\nThe lake is almost like two lakes connected by a shallow, narrow channel. The north end where the launch ramp is located provides the deep, cool water that makes this lake one of the best trout lakes in Mason County. Shoreline residents tell of many big trout caught in this lake. I once caught an eighteen inch rainbow trout while casting a large crankbait for bass. Trolling pop-gear and worms may be the best way to entice these big bows but trolling small hotshots and flatfish are also quite productive. Of course the ubiquitous Power Bait works well here also.\n\nThe south portion of the lake also provides good fishing for both the bass and trout. It has a quite large island and two smaller islands.\n\nAs far as I know for sure, the fish species include largemouth bass and planted rainbow trout. Brown bullhead catfish are also reported to be present.\n			To get to Mason County’s Lost Lake, drive to Shelton and take the Cloquallum Road southwest eight miles from the overpass over Highway 101 to Lost Lake Road. Turn right onto Lost Lake Road for 1.1 miles to the WDFW public access on the left.	http://www.washingtonlakes.com/FeaturedLake.aspx?id=495

546	5443	1		Fruitland Bible Camp was founded by Rev. Edwin Torgerson in 1943.  While living in a small service station on a back country crossroad and pioneering a rural church, this man  of vision laid the foundation for a camp and ministry that has endured and continues to impact lives far beyond his lifespan.  Reverend Torgerson the Fruitland Bible Camp Meeting following what he felt was divine direction.  Pastor Torgerson felt the need to call for fellowship with churches and believers of like faith in a place and time of spiritual inspiration, as a means to reach and meet the spiritual needs of the region.  He was the leader of the early camps, yet quickly recruited other pastors and lay leaders of the region to work as a committee to lead and oversee the Camp Meeting.  In early 1954 Rev. Torgerson accepted the pastorate in Malone, WA which is more than 400 miles away.  So at that time he turned the camp over to capable leaders in the area.  It was then that the property was transfered to Fruitland Camp Meeting Association.\n\nThrough the ensuing years the membership has approved many changes, including the purchase of 4 additional parcels of land, construction of 41 buildings and updating the name to Fruitland Bible Camp.  Rev. Torgerson maintained a long term relationship with the camp through regular attendance over the years and often reminded all who would listen of the mission of the Camp Meeting, " Nothing is impossible when your dream comes from God ". \n\nOver the years the Fruitland Bible Camp has grown and adapted from tents, teepees and scab lumber cabins to cottages, modern dorms, multi-family units, and a 40+ unit RV facility with hookups.  The camp will celebrate its 70th Anniversary in 2013 with a classic Summer Camp Meeting including strong preaching, gospel music and great home-style meals.  Families both young and old still come from miles around to stay for a few days or a whole week of Camp Meeting.\n\nAs the camp moves aggressively through the 21st century, camp leadership continues to have an unwavering commitment to the focus and mission of Rev. Torgerson's legacy and original vision.			Fruitland Bible Camp   5876 Mudgett Lake Rd    Fruitland, WA 99129-9756    509-722-3665 or 800-218-1094	http://www.fruitlandbiblecamp.com/#!complete-history

The seniors come in the mornings; workers drop in at lunch time or on the way home; and families come in the evenings. There is often someone in the garden, enjoying the solitude, losing the day's worries by working in the soil, picking some of Helen's scarlet poppies, blue bachelor buttons or golden calendulas near her sign, which says, "Pick some of these to enjoy." The garden is filled with memories of past gardeners: white-haired gentlemen, like old Bruno and his meticulous garden, and John who carefully cut the grass and painted the shed. Their legacy lives on, even though the gardeners change from year to year, the techniques they have learned from one another keep reappearing; those new to gardening learning from the veterans. At Evanston, there is always the garden to bring peace, solace, and friendship. 	A little bit of everything!

553	5631	1		Escazú is a colonial town in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. It's elevation is about 1,100m or 3,600 ft. It lies on the slopes of the Cerros de Escazu mountain range. The highest point on this range is known as Cerro Rabo de Mico, and has an altitude of 7,966 ft above sea level. 	 It has a moist, tropical climate, with an average yearly temperature of about 75 to 80 degrees fahrenheit. The town experiences two seasons, a rainy season and a dry season. During the rainy season, we get what is called the Veranillo de San Juan, which is a several week dry period during the summer solstice. 			
554	4432	5		The Cerro Rabo de Mico is the highest mountain of the Cerros de Escazú mountain range with an elevation of 2,428 m (7,966 ft).	The mountains are largely forested, however fields have been cleared by the local campesinos to raise cattle on. It is often very windy on the cleared fields, and the clouds passing over the mountain keep it fairly moist. 	Some common or interesting genera and species found on Cerro Rabo de Mico:\nRussulas\nHygrocybes\nPanaeolus (Antillarum and Cyanescens common) \nLactarius Indigo \nAleuria aurantia\nPleurocybella porrigens\nMyxogastria Sp.\nAseroe rubra\nCoprinellus disseminatus\n	Much of the land is privately owned, and you might have to make your way through some barbed wire fences to get around.

There are a few tiny outcrops of limestone that hitched a ride on the granite uplift.  Alluvia of course fills the valley bottoms and flood plains.		These hills are almost entirely private land.  I think they are at least somewhat protected as a botanical reserve, but I can find no record of this on-line.  There are no marked entry points to West Butte.  I found a gated 4wd road into the main valley on the southeastern side.  No one bothered me, but I don't know the official status.  I saw signs giving (minimal) instructions for hunters on the north side of the middle butte and the west side of East Butte.

575	5790	1		The Central District is a mostly residential district in Seattle located east of Cherry Hill, west of Madrona and Leschi, south of Capitol Hill, and north of Rainier Valley. Historically, the Central District has been one of Seattle's most racially and ethnically diverse neighborhoods,[1] and is the center of Seattle's black community.[2]\n\nThe culture and demographics of the Central District have changed repeatedly throughout many years. It started out as a predominantly Jewish neighborhood.[3] Jewish residents built Temple De Hirsch on Union Street in 1907;[4] Temple De Hirsch Sinai on the opposite corner of the same block is a successor to that congregation; the original Temple De Hirsch is largely demolished, though some fragments remain. Other former synagogues in the neighborhood are the former Sephardic Bikur Holim synagogue (now Tolliver Temple), Herzl Congregation synagogue (now Odessa Brown Clinic), and Chevra Bikur Cholim (now Langston Hughes Performing Arts Center).\n\nA few decades later the Central District became a home to Japanese-Americans in Seattle. The blocks between 14th and 18th Avenues and Yesler Way and Jackson Street still retain a strong Japanese presence—the Buddhist Church, Seattle Koyasan Church, Konko, Wisteria Park, Japanese Congregational Church, Keiro Nursing Home, and the Kawabe Memorial House. During the World War II, presidential Executive Order 9066 made possible the removal of American citizens of Japanese descent from the West Coast. All Japanese residents were immediately taken out of their homes and sent to internment camps. This and many race restricted covenants to the north and south paved the way for many African Americans to find a new home in the Central District.[5] By the 1970s Central District became largely an African-American neighborhood and the center of the civil rights movement in Seattle. However, it also marked the neighborhood's decline into poverty and crime for another two decades.\n\nIn the early 21st century, several demographic trends are changing the population of the Central District again. Low-income segments of the population are moving southward toward the Rainier Valley, while more affluent residents, who might otherwise have purchased homes on Capitol Hill, or Madrona, are moving into the Central District as real estate and rental property become more expensive in the former neighborhoods and commuting times and costs make suburban areas less attractive.[6]\n\nDue to this market pressure, housing in the Central District is mixed, with some homes on the verge of condemnation, and others having recently undergone extensive renovation. Many condemned houses are being replaced by multi-unit townhouses and condominiums. Easy access to Interstate 5, Interstate 90, and Downtown, as well as ample street parking, also make the Central District an attractive and convenient place to live.\n\nDespite these demographic shifts, many locals still refer to the Central District as a predominantly African-American area. One possible reason for this is that despite the decline in the African-American population, blacks have a large presence in the neighborhood. The neighborhood still has a high concentration of black or African-American residents for the Pacific Northwest. It is currently home to the Northwest African American Museum and the northern part of the neighborhood is coextensive with King County census tract 88 which is the only census tract in the Pacific Northwest with a majority black or African-American population.[7]\n\nDuring the early 1960s, the neighborhood was a hotbed for the Seattle civil rights movement. In 1963, civil rights protesters took to the streets and protested against racial discrimination. Later, they participated in a sit-in in downtown Seattle. At the same time, the Black Panthers used the neighborhood as a staging area for their movement.\n\nAs of 2000 the total population of the Central Area is 30,397, of which 53.1% are White, 31.4% are African-American, 5.9% Asian, 5.5% Multiracial, 3.1% Other Races, 0.8% Native American, and 0.3% Pacific Islander.[8]\nNotable residents\n\n    Linda Emery\n    Jimi Hendrix\n    Quincy Jones\n    Bruce Lee\n    Rose McGowan\n    Brandon Roy\n    Isaiah Stanback\n    Sir Mix-a-Lot\n    NoClue\n\nThoroughfares\n\nThe Central District's main thoroughfares are Martin Luther King Jr. Way ("MLK" or "MiLK") and 23rd Avenue (north- and southbound) and E.

It also hosts a regional Alabama DNR headquarters on Harris Station Road. \n\nMaps for Swan Creek are available from the Alabama DNR website online in ".pdf" format. 	Located in the Southeastern US, and bounded by the Lake Wheeler portion of the Tennessee River, Swan Creek WMA is relatively flat in topography and has a number of low-lying areas subject to flooding.

736	6612	1		The Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, also referred to as the Metro Bus Tunnel, is a 1.3-mile (2.1 km) public transit tunnel that runs the length of downtown Seattle, from 9th Avenue and Pike Street to 5th Avenue S. and S. Jackson Street. Approved by Metro Transit in 1983,[3] construction began in 1987.[4] It was completed and service began in 1990, at a total cost of $455 million.[4] In May 2000, the King County Council transferred ownership to Sound Transit[5] but ownership was transferred back to King County Metro in 2002.[2]\n\nThe tunnel was closed on September 24, 2005 for modification to accommodate both buses and Sound Transit's Central Link light rail trains on a shared alignment. Prior to closure, around two dozen bus routes ran through the tunnel. The buses were dual-powered, using electricity in the tunnel from an above wire connection and diesel on city streets. It reopened on Monday, September 24, 2007.[6] The two-year closure included retrofits for light rail as well as other operating system upgrades. Also, a stub tunnel, branching from the main tunnel, was constructed under Pine Street between 7th and Boren Avenues to allow light rail trains to stop and reverse direction and for future extension of Central Link.[7]\n\nDue to the conversion to light rail, the dual-mode buses that are powered by the above electric connection can no longer operate in the tunnel. Those buses have already been replaced by Metro's current new fleet of hybrid buses.These buses produce significantly less emissions than the dual-mode buses they replaced, produce fewer emissions than standard diesel buses, and, unlike the dual-mode buses, require no connection to overhead wires.[8]\n\nSince the floor of the tunnel was lowered for the light rail, there have been concerns that the bus mirrors are now at head height and may strike those who are waiting on the platform. To prevent this, the mirrors are equipped with flashing lights. As well, the buses' speed limit as they approach and leave stations has been lowered from 15 miles per hour (24 km/h) to 10 miles per hour (16 km/h).\n\nConvention Place Station Serves Washington State Convention Center, Paramount Theatre, Greyhound Lines terminal, Federal Courthouse. Transfer to surface bus or cross Interstate 5 to Capitol Hill. Bus routes from south of the tunnel have their terminus and layover here. This station is a future transit-oriented development site.[13]\nThis station is served only by buses.	Planter Boxes	Mycena	Public	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Seattle_Transit_Tunnel

839	6638	1		Mountlake Terrace is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It is a northern suburb of Seattle and lies east of Edmonds, Washington, south of Lynnwood, Washington, and west of Brier, Washington. Its southern boundary runs along the King County line. Interstate 5 runs north-south through the city, and services the city via three exits. The population was 19,909 at the 2010 United States Census.\n\nIn the nineteenth century the Mountlake Terrace site was thickly forested. Natives criss-crossed the area to hunt, gather berries and dig roots. The thick forested land was obtained by the Puget Mill Company in 1862. By 1900 most of the land in south Snohomish County had been logged off, so Pope & Talbot Co. (the successor entity to the Puget Mill Co.), subdivided it into 10-acre (40,470 m²) "chicken ranches". This effort was moderately successful (the larger area was known as Alderwood Manor during this time), as a few people moved into the area to raise chicken, mink and chinchilla. An interurban rail line between Tacoma, Washington and Everett, Washington (1910) allowed easier access. Many of those small farms failed during the Great Depression, and the railroad was abandoned in 1939.\n\nA portion of the area was used by the government during World War II as a landing field. At the end of the war the government ceased operation, and in 1949 Albert LaPierre and Jack Peterson[3] bought the abandoned airstrip and began filling it with modest cinder-block houses. They named their development Mountlake Terrace because from some parts of the property they could see both Mount Rainier and Lake Washington, and the old runway looked a little like a terrace.\nIncorporation\n\nIn 1954 over 5,000 people lived in the area between 244th and 216th Streets SW, and 48th and 68th Avenues W. The existing infrastructure was overwhelmed by this unplanned growth; people waited a year for a party-line telephone; streets were unpaved; house sanitation was provided by individual septic systems. The nearest police department was in Everett, 15 miles away. One frustrated resident, Patrick McMahan, organized the Mountlake Terrace Study Committee, which led a campaign to incorporate the community. An election (23 November 1954) supported incorporation, 517 to 483. Voters chose a five-person city council at the same election. The council had its first meeting on November 24 and selected Gilbert "Gil" Geiser (1919–1997), a 35-year-old hardware store owner, as Mountlake Terrace's first mayor. Geiser had to lend the new city $5 so the incorporation papers could be filed. With the filing, on November 29, Mountlake Terrace officially became a third-class city.\nEarly growth\n\nMountlake Terrace's population doubled between 1950 and 1960 and then nearly doubled again by 1970. Small businesses flourished in two strip-mall-type shopping centers in the middle of the area, on land provided by the developers. The developers also donated land for several churches, including the parish of St. Pius X, which celebrated its first mass on 22 June 1955. The John Fluke Corporation moved its electronics center from Seattle to Mountlake Terrace in 1959. In 1961 a bond issue was approved in a special election; it was used to build a City Hall.\nSlowing of development\n\nThe city had been first envisioned as an automobile-based bedroom community, but subsequent leaders began to envision it as a "stand-alone" development with a viable downtown area. This effort was aided by the arrival of Fluke and the construction of the two strip malls and the City Hall. However, the 1980s brought a standstill. The Boeing Company suffered a significant business downturn (about 75% of the Everett workers lost their jobs in that decade); Lynnwood opened a large mall (Alderwood Mall) which drew much of the area's business away from downtown; and in 1990 two arson-caused fires in the city center caused significant destruction.[4] In 1981 Fluke moved its facility to Everett. The 1980 census showed that Mountlake Terrace's population had dropped by almost 5 percent in 10 years. The city budget was trimmed and trimmed again and even so, Mountlake Terrace entered 1989 with a $1.3 million deficit.\nRecent history\nIntersection of 236th St SW and 56th Ave W in downtown Mountlake Terrace.\n\nThe mid-2000s saw new construction on 56th Avenue, and in 2006 the city created a plan to revitalize downtown and encourage economic activity.[5][6] As of 2006 the town's largest employer was Premera Blue Cross, which employed some 2,400 people.\n\nA city-center plan adopted in February 2007 allows mixed-use buildings of up to seven stories in the central block and up to five stories in surrounding blocks. The previous limit was three stories. The city-center plan is slowly taking shape, starting with the intersection of 236th street and 56th avenue (shown at right), where a large-scale construction project is taking place, causing the eviction of some small businesses in the area.\nGeography\n\nMountlake Terrace is located at 47°47′27″N 122°18′24″W (47.790969, -122.306636).[7] The city's elevation above sea level ranges between 262 and 530 feet (160 m), with an average altitude of 440 feet (130 m).\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 4.2 square miles (10.7 km2), of which, 4.0 square miles (10.5 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) is water. The total area is 2.65% water.\n\nThe southwestern portion of the city includes Lake Ballinger Park, which offers access to Lake Ballinger and contains a boat launch and a fishing pier. The lake itself is located partially in Mountlake Terrace and partially in neighboring Edmonds.[8]				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountlake_Terrace,_Washington
840	6647	1		Downtown is the central business district of Seattle, Washington. It is fairly compact compared to other city centers on the West Coast because of its geographical situation: hemmed in on the north and east by hills, on the west by the Elliott Bay, and on the south by reclaimed land that was once tidal flats. It is bounded on the north by Denny Way, beyond which are Lower Queen Anne (sometimes known as "Uptown"), Seattle Center, and South Lake Union; on the east by Broadway Avenue, beyond which is the Central District; on the south by Dearborn Avenue, beyond which is Sodo; and on the west by Elliott Bay. Belltown, the Denny Triangle, Pioneer Square, Chinatown, the West Edge, and the western flank of First Hill are sub-neighborhoods of Downtown. Near the center of Downtown is the Metropolitan Tract, owned by the University of Washington, the location of the university's pre-1895 campus. Downtown is Seattle's main financial district, waterfront, and shopping area (surrounding Westlake Center and connected to Seattle Center by way of a monorail), which make up the bulk of Downtown. It is also home to the landmark Pike Place Market.\n\nDowntown Seattle's Columbia Center has a greater number of floors than any other building west of the Mississippi River, at 76, though there are taller buildings in Texas and California by height. (Smith Tower, in the older section of Downtown near the waterfront, once held the title of tallest American building west of the Mississippi.) Other notable buildings are the Washington Mutual Tower, Two Union Square, Nordstrom’s flagship store, Benaroya Hall, the new Seattle Central Library designed by Rem Koolhaas, and the main building of the Seattle Art Museum (built 1991, expanded 2007), the main facade of which was designed by Robert Venturi. Downtown parks include Westlake Park, Freeway Park, and Victor Steinbrueck Park. The Olympic Sculpture Park was completed on the Belltown waterfront in January 2007.	Concrete	Hericium	Public. 	
841	6655	1		Paris Non-Human Primates is a “Consulting Service Offering Solutions for Biomedical Research Resources”, but is more accurately a peddler of monkeys. Paris NHP specializes in the selling of macaque monkeys, for use in inhumane and scientifically unsound experiments that are dangerous to human health. Vivisection is barbaric and archaic, and is costing more lives than it is saving. More than 9 out of 10 medicines that are tested on animals fail in human clinical trials as cited by the FDA. Pseudo-science aside, shockingly on their own website Paris NHP proudly lists their clients, including known animal abusers such as SNBL (see back for more on them), and The Scripps Institute.\n\nParis NHP breeds their “product” at Bogor Agricultural University in Indonesia, where investigators have said:\n\n“"The BUAV investigators visited one holding facility at the IPB which they were told infant and juvenile long-tailed macaques who had been taken there after they had been trapped on Tinjil Island. The facility contained a number of small rooms, each containing one small chain link pen housing around 15-20 monkeys. The pens were a barren environment with a metal grid floor. There was no substrate for the monkeys to play or dig in. There was virtually no enrichment, just a few perches. The monkeys could only climb the side of the pens and there was nowhere for them to hide from each other or people. The pens were indoors so there was no fresh air and limited sunlight through one window. Only one pen was seen to have a water bottle attached to it. The others had free standing bowls made from either rubber or plastic. In at least one pen, this bowl was empty, leaving the monkeys no access to water. The only evidence of food was a few pieces of monkey chow seen on the wire floor of one pen. In other pens no food was visible. The areas underneath the pens were covered in waste and what appeared to be monkey chow biscuits that had fallen through the grid floor. Mold could be seen growing on some of the food. This was a stressful environment in which these monkeys were forced to live. These conditions were in stark contrast to living freely in family groups in a natural environment on Tinjil Island."\n	Landscaped	Parmellia	Private businesses	Personal

911	6877	1		First Hill is a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, named for the hill on which it is located. The hill, in turn, is so named for being the first hill one encounters traveling east from downtown Seattle toward Lake Washington. First Hill is bounded on the west by Interstate 5, beyond which is Downtown, on the north by E. Pike and E. Madison Streets, beyond which is Capitol Hill, and on the south by S. Main St., beyond which is the International District. Its eastern limit, beyond which is the Central District, is bounded by Broadway and Boren Avenue.[1]\n\nFirst Hill rose to popularity in the 1890s as a location close enough to downtown for convenience, but far enough out to offer a sense of retreat for the wealthier residents of Seattle. Among the elite to live on First Hill at that time were Indian fighter turned wealthy businessman Granville O. Haller, local judge Cornelius H. Hanford, successful meatpacker Charles Frye (whose private art collection is now open to the public at First Hill's Frye Art Museum), contractor Morgan Carkeek (for whom Carkeek Park is named), William Boeing, founder of the Boeing Company and Judge Hiram Bond. Noted photographer Imogen Cunningham and her husband Roi Partridge lived on First Hill in a boarding house in the 1910s until the residents of the house were evicted and the property converted into a hospital. More recently, local philanthropist and businesswoman Patsy Collins resided in a First Hill condominium.\n\nThe first official King County Courthouse was built on First Hill in 1889-1890; the steep climb to the courthouse from downtown legal offices caused such frequent and vociferous complaints that Seattle lawyers nicknamed the area "Profanity Hill." The courthouse, constructed on the corner of 7th Avenue and Alder Street, was quickly outgrown, which, along with the loud dissatisfaction of local attorneys, led the county to move the courthouse off First Hill in 1916.\n\nThe hill is also known as "Pill Hill" because, in addition to being the current home of three major health care facilities (Harborview Medical Center, Swedish Medical Center/First Hill, and Virginia Mason Medical Center (four if Swedish Medical Center/Cherry Hill, located on 16th Avenue, is included in the neighborhood), as well as the Puget Sound Blood Center, it was also once the location of the Maynard, Seattle General, and Doctors Hospitals (all of which merged into Swedish) as well as Cabrini Hospital.\n\nFirst Hill has been home to Seattle University, a private Jesuit university, since 1898. Also located on the hill are Northwest School and Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences--two highly regarded private schools--and the Catholic O'Dea High School, as well as several churches that have become city landmarks: Trinity Episcopal Parish Church, St. James Cathedral, and Seattle First Baptist Church.\n\nFirst Hill's major thoroughfares, assuming its greatest possible extent (see above), include Madison, James, Cherry, and Jefferson Streets and Yesler Way (east- and west-bound) and 9th, Boren, and Broadway (north- and south-bound).

The Protected Landscape of Corno do Bico is one of six protected landscapes in Portugal, and its management committed to the Municipality of Paredes de Coura. It is a natural sanctuary with an area of ​​about 2175 hectares, and covers five parishes of Paredes de Coura: Bico, Castanheiro, Cristelo, Parada and Vascões. (...)\n\n\nThe fortified settlements in the Neolithic funerary monuments and milestones resist Corno do Bico, as witnesses of other times. The granaries, mills, and the terraced fields that complete harmony landscape, still reflect the current rurality and effort of the people who have come to occupy this region. (...)\n\n\nApart from enjoying the status of protected landscape, this region is almost entirely included in the National List of Sites of Community Importance included in the Natura 2000 network under the Habitats Directive, being an area of ​​high conservation importance a variety of habitats and threatened species in Europe."\n\n	It is an essentially mountainous region, but with rounded contours, and Corno do Bico (with 883 m high) is the elevation of higher altitude. On top of these hills, you can see “caos de blocos”, clusters of granite blocks (the region’s dominant rock) that give the landscape a chaotic look. In the verdant slopes, you can see, slashing the landscape, low walls and terraces – a testament to the simple human influence on the landscape – that allow the practice of agriculture and provide a very characteristic to the region. Are included in this region of the headwaters of three major rivers Minho: Coura, Labrujo and Vez. The climate is temperate, Atlantic markedly, with heavy rain (except for short periods of summer) and warm temperatures.	Regarding the local vegetation, the carvalhal is the dominant, representing about 25% of the landscape. This important forest of oaks is relatively young: it was planted during the ’40s, and remains very well preserved. The oak is a mixed forest dominated by deciduous, among which stands out the oak (Quercus robur). Beyond the oak, there are other plant communities that are important, such as riparian forests (situated on the banks of watercourses and dominated by ash (Fraxinus angustifolia) and alder (Alnus glutinosa)), patches of pine forest, marshes and a bog. In total, there are 439 species of flora in the Corno do Bico, and several of these are particularly relevant because they have varying degrees of endemism and rarity: examples are Bruchia vogesiaca, Narcissus cyclamineus, Veronica micrantha, among others.\n\nThe fauna of the region is also rich in variety of species. Were recorded in the area 188 species of vertebrates, there is little information with regard to invertebrates. The diversity of habitats, the interaction between them, and the climatic conditions of the region, allow this area to provide a wide range of excellent resources for feeding, breeding and shelter to various animals.\nHowever, not only is the variety of species contributes to the importance of faunal communities in the region. This importance is also based on the existence of value species from the standpoint of conservation helps to solidify the Protected Landscape in the Corno do Bico heritage as an urge to preserve – were identified in area 25 vertebrate species with high conservation priority. So in Corno do Bico can find species like the Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus), the Lusitanian-salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica), the viper-of-seoane (Vipera seoanei), the mole-of-water (Galemys pyrenaicus) and hunter-harrier (Circus pygargus), among many others. Several of these species are endemic or are under varying degrees of threat, which helps to increase the value of fauna protected landscape of the Corno do Bico.		http://www.cornodebico.pt/portal/

1144	7373	1		Calaveras Big Trees State Park is a state park of California, USA, preserving two groves of giant sequoia trees. It is located 4 miles (6.4 km) northeast of Arnold, California in the middle elevations of the Sierra Nevada. It has been a major tourist attraction since 1852, when the existence of the trees was first widely reported, and is considered the longest continuously operated tourist facility in California. The area was declared a state park in 1931 and now encompasses 6,498 acres (2,630 ha) in Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties.[1]\n\nOver the years other parcels of mixed conifer forests, including the much larger South Calaveras Grove of Giant Sequoias (purchased in 1954 for $2.8 million USD), have been added to the park to bring the total area to about 26 square kilometres (6,400 acres). The North Grove contains about 100 mature giant sequoias; the South Grove, about 1,000.\n\nThe North Grove included the 'Discovery Tree' noted by Augustus T. Dowd in 1852 and felled in 1853, leaving a giant stump which is the only remainder of the tree. It measured 24 feet (7.3 m) in diameter at its base and was determined by ring count to be 1,244 years old when felled. However, the largest tree was believed to be the Mother of the Forest, which was cut down in the mid-nineteenth century and dwarfed any tree alive today.\n\nIn addition to the popular North Grove, the park also now includes the South Grove, with a 5-mile (8.0 km) hiking trip through a grove of giant sequoias in their natural setting. The South Grove includes the Louis Agassiz tree, 250 feet (76 m) tall and 25 feet (7.6 m) in diameter 6 feet (1.8 m) above ground, the largest tree in the Calaveras groves.[2] It is named after zoologist Louis Agassiz (1807–1873).\n\nOther attractions in the Park include the Stanislaus River, Beaver Creek, the Lava Bluff Trail and Bradley Trail.\n\nThe park also houses two main campgrounds with a total of 129 campsites, six picnic areas and hundreds of miles of established trails.\n\nOther activities include cross-country skiing, evening ranger talks, numerous interpretive programs, environmental educational programs, junior ranger programs, hiking, mountain biking, bird watching and summer school activities for school children. Dogs are welcome in the park on leash in developed areas like picnic sites, campgrounds, roads and fire roads (dirt). Dogs are not allowed on the designated trails, nor in the woods in general.

1155	6184	4	Missouri Department of Conservation	Famous as the setting for Beetle Bailey comic strip, author Mort Walker was stationed/trained there.\n\nFort Crowder Conservation Area, located in southern Newton County, was once part of the old, World War II Camp Crowder Army Base. The U.S. Army selected the Neosho site for the base because of its proximity to water, railroads, and highways.\n\nVisitors to the area can still see foundations, fruit trees, open fields and other remnants of many of the hundreds of small farms purchased by the federal government for the 60,000-acre base.\n\nCamp Crowder was named for Judge Advocate General and U.S. Ambassador to Cuba Enoch H. Crowder.\n\nThousands of soldiers went through basic training here before the camp was decommissioned in the mid 1950s, including Mort Walker, who immortalized the Camp as Camp Swampy in his syndicated comic strip, Beetle Bailey.\n\n	Fort Crowder Conservation Area, encompassing 2,362 acres, is approximately 60 percent forested. Primary species include white, black, post, blackjack and red oaks, hackberry, elm, black cherry, black walnut, and ash. The remainder of the area is open and includes 200 acres of native warm-season grasses, 100 acres of crop fields and 600 acres of fields maintained in an early successional stage.	Xanthoconium

1162	8115	1		In Southwest Missouri, Barry County, near Cassville. From Cassville travel south on Highway 112 for about 7 miles. Look for the park office on the right (west) side of the road.	This site features a variety of environmental conditions, from dry cherty ridges and shoulder slopes to more mesic ravine bottoms.  On the ridges look for post oak and black oak with blueberries in the understory.  On occasion sprouts of the Ozark chinquapin occur on these cherty ridges.  Unfortunately Ozark chinquapin, like American chestnut, is susceptible to the chestnut blight, a fungus that attacks tree species in the genus Castanea.  The fungus is a native of Asia and arrived in the U.S. in the early 20th century.  Eventually fungal spores made their way to the Ozarks after decimating the chestnut forests of Appalachia.  Today the Ozark chinquapin only gets to sapling size before succumbing to the fungus.  However, the tenacious rootstocks of these trees continue to resprout.\n\nAround limestone and dolomite outcrops look for gnarled and stunted chinkapin oaks.  Below the rock outcrops along the ravine bottom are more moist conditions that favor northern red oak, sugar maple and spicebush.  Look for summer tanager, black-and-white warbler, and red-eyed vireo on the ridges and slopes.  Down low keep a look out for wood thrush and Kentucky warbler.

1172	8516	1		The forest of Mont St. Hilaire is part of the larger Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forests that are transitional between the boreal forests to the north and the eastern deciduous forests to the south. The dominant trees are sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Unlike the St. Lawrence Valley as a whole, the forest on the mountain is very little or not at all disturbed by human activity. Various natural disturbances have struck the forest over the centuries, but many trees are in excess of 120 years old. Some sugar maple trees in excess of 400 years old have been found. The forest at Mont St. Hilaire is among the 13 remaining tracts of old-growth forest in the St. Lawrence Valley and is the largest remnant in the Montreal region. The site is scientifically important as one of the few remaining examples of the primeval forests in this part of North America.Mont Saint-Hilaire is an isolated hill, 414 m (1,358 ft) high, in the Montérégie region of southern Quebec. It is about thirty kilometres east of Montreal, and immediately east of the Richelieu River. It is one of the Monteregian Hills.

1174	8569	1		Clifford park boasts over 80 acres, it is also right next to 16,000 undeveloped acres in the Biddeford-Kennebunkport Vernal Pool Complex. There are lots of trails for hiking and biking. The terrain is fairly rocky in some places. There is a 1.6 mile loop as well as many smaller trails.\n\nThe following is taken from http://www.sacobaytrails.org/cliffordpark.shtml\n\n\n"Located a few minutes from downtown Biddeford, Clifford Park contains far more trails than we could show on our map. A large map sign located beside the Pool Road parking lot shows the most significant trails and their color-coded trail markers. Although the park can be crossed in a straight line in a half mile, the large number of informal trails makes it easy to Òget turned aroundÓ. A compass is recommended for your first few visits.\n\nOld granite quarries on the higher land near the center of the park remind us of earlier days when foundation stones were cut from the park's granite ledges. Ancient trees and a variety of terrain entertain the visitor. The falling waters of West Brook border two sides of the park. A trail is being proposed to connect West Brook Pond, where skating is popular, to allow X-country skiers to reach the park. Black Trail circles the park for a 1.3 mile walk. The marking system uses colored rings painted completely around tree trunks.\n\nClifford Park was purchased, well below market value, for $1,500 in 1894 from the Clifford family who wished to help preserve its natural beauty for future generations of area residents.\n\nIt was dedicated on the 4th of July in 1896. During that festive dedication ceremony, City Councilor Dr. Bassford noted during his remarks, "How many of our citizens are not aware how beautiful this spot is; they have never visited it and do not know of its charm and grandeur. More than100 years later, are we also too busy to enjoy its special beauty?""

1176	8670	1		"This trail leads through a forest of white pines, red maples and cinnamon ferns, transitions through an area of mixed shrubs and pitch pines, and ends at a platform with bench overlooking the salt marsh at Goosefare Brook.\n\nThis trail is one of many blazed by the late Ted Wells, a longtime resident of Ocean Park. He was an extraordinary naturalist, teacher and musician who saw the importance of the salt marsh ecosystem and worked to preserve it. Ted named this trail the White Dot Trail for the manner in which it was marked. When Saco Bay Trails rebuilt this trail in 2002-04 it was renamed in Ted's honor."\n\nhttp://www.sacobaytrails.org/tedwells.shtml

The 1,300-acre preserve, bounded by suburban development and within earshot of interstate traffic, has the feel of an exotic, tranquil island. It is the southern-most example of a “coalesced domed bog” in North America, and the only known location in the world where Atlantic white cedar grows on this type of peatland. The preserve also harbors a wide range of flora and fauna including the state’s only population of Hessel’s hairstreak butterfly."\n\nRead more at Trails.com: Saco Heath Preserve Trail | Saco Maine Hikes | Trails.com http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.aspx?trailId=XAC022-002#ixzz2lDI4sCPF\n				
1178	8518	1		City of DePere, Wisconsin, which actually includes both the East and West sides of the Fox River. Harder to map out on the grid since it is at an angle parallel to the Fox River which runs in a NNE direction.	Mainly suburban with patches of riparian, and wetland habitats.	Stinkhorns, Giant Puffballs, Fairy Rings (you can tell the age of the suburban area by the size of the fairy rings in the yards).	Best places to look for non-lawn species are The Reserve near Humana on the west side, the East River Trail, and The Fox River Trail.\n\nLots of lawn species but edible mushrooms are questionable as there seems to be a lot of chemical lawn companies used.	
1179	8528	1		The Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary is a beautiful 700 acre urban wildlife refuge featuring live animal exhibits, educational displays, miles of hiking/skiing trails and various wildlife viewing opportunities. It is the largest park in the Green Bay Park system and home to the second largest wildlife rehabilitation program in Wisconsin, caring for more than 4,500 orphaned and injured animals annually.\n\nThe Sanctuary attracts hundreds of thousands of bird watchers, families and other visitors from across the USA and many foreign countries each year. They come to explore and discover nature while learning the importance of preserving natural landscapes.\n\nFirst established in 1936 as a site for waterfowl rehabilitation, the Sanctuary has grown to offer environmental education programs to over 10,000 students, nature walks, urban fishing, summer camps, cross country skiing and much more. Click here for more information about the history of the Wildlife Sanctuary.	Habitat is made up of wet woods, including cottonwood, basswood, spruce. There is one cattail marsh and several manmade impoundment ponds on site. Because this is a remnant shoreline of the bay, there is a lot of woody debris as soil. There is also an abundance of non-native species including buckthorn, garlic mustard, and European hay plants.	Dryad Saddles, Inky Caps, Elm Oysters, Witches Butter

1182	4581	1		Along windswept beaches and cliffs, visitors experience where water meets land and sky, culture meets culture, and past meets present. The 21 islands and 12 miles of mainland host a unique blend of cultural and natural resources.  Lighthouses shine over Lake Superior and the new wilderness areas. Visitors can hike, paddle, sail, or cruise to experience these Jewels of Lake Superior.	Islands vary. Many of the island have balsam, spruce, birch and aspen. Some of the islands have beach and bog habitats. Islands with lighthouses have old growth, and often virgin forest, around the lighthouse if not the entire island. Raspberry, Devils, Michigan, Outer and Sand Island all have thick old growth reserves. Duff layer on Raspberry is 6-8" deep. Yew also dominates this island. Historic junk piles also provide interesting fungal finds. Hemlock, cedar and yellow birch also available.	Mushroom finds are good, but especially interesting is the diversity and proliferation of mushroom species. Mushrooms were always available and sitting on a log on an inland portion, 10 species or more can be found within just a few feet. Most memorable are really rainy seasons. Hundreds of Helvella crispa on the north facing clay banks of Raspberry. A huge diversity of russulas, pholiota, cortinarius, cantherullus, mycena, boletus, amanita. Dead man's fingers and other ascomycetes everywhere.\n\n	Public but mushroom harvesting by permit only and for scientific purposes only.\n\nA strange phenomenon that I noticed was that like the plant life that was in bloom on the mainland one week, two weeks later it bloomed just a couple miles from the mainland. This late bloom was also notable with mushrooms. If gyromitras were in season on the mainland in early May, they would not reach the islands until mid-may.\n\nGetting out to the islands can be challenging/costly storms appear quickly. \n\nMadeline is not part of the Park and has more private property.\n\nThere are no hotels/shelters on the island so better to do a day trip if you don't like wilderness camping.\n\nTrails are available, but diversity is best explored off trail, which can be challenging due to thick growth of yew, sometimes 10 feet high, and many downed logs. Even with GPS, it is best to bring a regular compass as the dense canopy can confuse the gps. Once in the canopy visual cues alone cannot be trusted, as sunlight cannot always be relied on. Easy to get lost in. \n	
1183	8920	1		Located in the Chequamegon National Forest, this unique habitat is worth finding mushrooms in.	Sandy soil, ephemeral ponds and lakes, frost pockets, the habitat is dominated by jack pine, sweetfern, sand cherry, bear berry, and waxy plants. Least chipmunks can be found here as well as upland sandpipers.	Many different interesting species can be found in the north facing slopes along roadsides and in frost pockets. Several species of fairy stools can be found here,	Weekends have fewer logging trucks on the roads. Roads can be in varying conditions as logging trucks wear heavily on them. Some roads requite four wheel drive and are sometimes so sandy, walking is a necessity.\n\nThe scent of sweetfern is well worth the visit.\n\nOrchids and frostweed, as well as barrens only associated plants can be found here.\n\nDuring summer its best to go before 10:oo or after 5:00 as it is like a hot desert during midday.

Development especially picked up when the Seattle-to-Everett Interurban streetcar reached the lake in 1906. A sawmill operated in the area until 1913, when most of the trees had been cut down.\n\nTo its east, across Aurora Avenue N., is the neighborhood of Haller Lake; to its west, across Greenwood Avenue N., is Broadview; to its north, across N. 145th Street, is the city of Shoreline; and to its south is Greenwood. N. 130th Street is often considered its southern boundary, although some place it further south, at N. 125th Street, N. 115th Street, or even N. 105th Street.\nPlayland, 1960\n\nBitter Lake played a more prominent role in Seattle at mid-20th century—when it was not yet officially part of the city—than it does today. From May 24, 1930 to 1961, it was home to Playland, one of several amusement parks built by the Washington Amusement Company. It was purchased a year after it opened by Carl E. Phare, a designer and builder of roller coasters, who designed The Dipper, a roller coaster with 3,400 feet (1,000 m) of track and a maximum altitude of 85 feet (26 m). Other notable attractions included The Canals of Venice, 1,200 feet (370 m) of darkness that may have been Seattle's most famous makeout spot for two generations, and a 9,600-square-foot (890 m2) hardwood floor dance pavilion. During the Great Depression, it was home to dance marathons and flagpole sitting contests.\n\nThe 12-acre (49,000 m2) amusement park, with parking for 12,000 cars, closed at the end of the 1961 season, under three economic pressures: the rise of television, the rising value of its lakefront real estate, and the impending Century 21 Exposition (the 1962 Seattle world's fair), which would dwarf a relatively small amusement park on the edge of town.\n\nPart of the site of Playland is now the R.H. Thomson Elementary School; the Bitter Lake Community Center sits near the onetime site of the Dipper.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_Lake,_Seattle
1285	10403	1		Licton Springs is both a residential neighborhood and a natural spring at the north end of Licton Springs Park, which has a long history as both a unique recreational spot and a commercial crossroads. The neighborhood, wedged between the busy corridors of Interstate 5 and Aurora Avenue, takes its name from Liq'tid (LEEK-teed) or Licton, the Lushootseed (Whulshootseed) Coast Salish word for the reddish mud of the springs—. The Dkhw’Duw’Absh, People of the Inside and Xacuabš, People of the Large Lake, Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish native people had used the springs area as a spiritual health spa since the area was populated after the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE—10,000 years ago). In the 1850s, the Dkhw’Duw’Absh and Xacuabš became the Duwamish tribe of today.\nEuropean settlement\n\nSeattle pioneer David Denny built a summer cabin near the springs around 1870. The natural spring fed Green Lake before it was capped and drained to the Metro sewer system after it became contaminated by residential development (1920, 1931). The Olmsted Brothers designed a park for Licton Springs, as part of a grand streets and parks plan for Seattle (1930s), but this park was never implemented. A park does exist today (where Woodlawn Avenue curves to connect with N 95th Street) in which the spring is located.[2] In the mid-1960s restoration began with bond issues and increasing volunteer assistance, resulting in a small pond and natural wetland vegetation as well as urban park amenities.[3] A Native American presence continues in the neighborhood through the Indian Heritage School at Wilson-Pacific. This school hosts frequent Indian Pow Wows and spectacular wall murals by Indian artist Andrew Morrison.\nMosaic tile at Licton Springs Park, Seattle, Washington\nExotic waterfowl habitat at Pillings Pond\n\nThe Everett and Interurban Railway Company (1900–1936)[4] came past the neighborhood in 1906. The trolleys became a part of everyday life and development of residential neighborhoods around trolley stops. Running on a narrow right-of-way through backyards, the whistle became part of the atmosphere of neighborhoods like Licton Springs. In the early years, the line ran through cut forest and rural farms. A few sawmills along the way gave the line a business hauling lumber. The rough wagon road became Aurora Avenue N (1930) after being paved with brick (1913) and asphalt (1928). A most distinctive early feature was the motorist "tourist camps", "auto camps", and later, "auto courts", then the now-familiar motels. One or two still remained at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThe Pilling family had a dairy farm (1909–1933), out of which grew the waterfowl habitat and birding site of Pilling's Pond today.[5] Japanese-Americans had greenhouses and small farms until they were abruptly forcibly removed with the Japanese American Internment (1942–1945).\nNorth College Park\n\nSeattle annexed most of North Seattle in 1954.[6] North College Park became defined with the Licton Springs neighborhood with the establishment of North Seattle Community College (1970).[7]\nFacing NW. Soon after 2006 renovation\n\nLicton Springs and the Sunny Walter–Pillings Pond are part of the Densmore Drainage Basin. The springs at the North Police Precinct and North Seattle Community College are headwaters of the south fork of Thornton Creek; this fork flows through culverts under I-5 and the south lot of Northgate Mall development.[5][8] These neighborhoods are natural extensions of Maple Leaf downstream.[9] Neighborhood activists and North Seattle Community College (NSCC) have been promoting habitat restoration in support.[8][9][10] NSCC grounds have a nationally-recognized native habitat, a pentimento of restored native species on a palimpsest of former 1940s suburb, former dairy farm, former bog where native Dkhw’Duw’Absh harvested cranberries.[11]				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licton_Springs,_Seattle
1286	10438	1		Greenwood is a neighborhood in north central Seattle, Washington, USA. The intersection of Greenwood Avenue North and North 85th Street is the commercial center. Greenwood is known for its numerous bars, restaurants, coffee houses and specialty stores.\n\nSince 1993 the neighborhood has hosted the "Greenwood Classic Car Show" on the last Saturday in June. Another event is the "Greenwood Seafair Parade", held on the last Wednesday in July. Both events draw tens of thousands of visitors to the neighborhood annually.\n\nThe heart of Greenwood lies atop a peat deposit, also known as a bog.[1] The area was molded into a bowl shape after the last glacial retreat, that was in turn, filled with runoff of dead plants that created the peat bog.[2]\n\nWhen groundwater is removed, the peat compresses, causing building settlement that cannot be undone.[2] Commercial development has created an impervious surface and diverted rainwater to city sewers. On August 22, 2008 the city added peat bogs to the list of Environmentally Critical Areas.[3] This is intended to encourage building techniques that would stabilize the ground water and reduce building settlement in the neighborhood.\n\nGreenwood has areas where streets and sidewalks have also been damaged due to irregular settlement. In 2012 the city of Seattle rebuilt North 85th Street and repaved much of Greenwood Avenue North. Many sidewalks along these streets were also repaired, though evidence of prior damage can still be seen.\n\nOriginally named Woodland, the neighborhood became Greenwood in 1907. Greenwood Avenue carried city streetcar and Seattle-Everett interurban passenger railroad traffic during the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nThe section of the neighborhood north of 85th Street was annexed to the city of Seattle in 1954. Many residents of the area voted for annexation, expecting that the city would build sidewalks. However, it is unconfirmed whether city officials ever made this promise. Many residential streets north of 85th Street are still without sidewalks.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood,_Seattle
1287	10460	1		Here's an unusual hike through a very mossy forest and along a narrow river canyon, past sites that were important in local history. A railroad once ran along the canyon, passing through small communities. Logging was done in the area, and lime once was produced from limestone here, in a kiln that still stands. The railroad and communities are gone now, and much has disappeared over the past eighty years. But a few artifacts still remain and can be seen near the trail.\n\nThe trailhead and much of the hike lie within the Robe Canyon Historic Park. Information about the park, and historical photos, are presented on a two-sided bulletin board at the trailhead. It's good material, although some of the text is printed in a relatively small font size, and glare from plastic covering the photos can make viewing them a challenge in some lighting conditions.\n\nThe route begins with a gentle climb of about 200 feet, followed by a gradual loss of about 600 feet before reaching a longer, nearly-level section along an old railroad grade. In fact, most of the elevation gain occurs on the return hike. The route crosses both public and private land, and the footing varies from old road beds to narrow, stony trail. There are numerous signs along the way, so route-finding is not a problem.\n\nBegin your hike in a forested area, with an exuberant growth of ferns below. Then venture out onto a former road that traverses private property. In late summer, you may find a few ripe blackberries - not the native variety - beside the trail. The route leaves the road and heads downhill on a narrow, stony path passing close to Hubbard Pond. But the undergrowth near the trail is quite dense and you may have difficulty seeing the water.\n\nThe route widens again, crosses a sturdy bridge and continues along another old road before turning left onto a narrow trail and heading downhill. You will hear the sounds of a creek off to the left, hidden beneath a lot of vegetation. The sound of flowing water increases as you approach the South Fork of the Stillaguamish, where the trail meets and continues along the former railroad grade.\n\nSigns along the grade offer bits of history, including the route and dates of the Everett and Monte Cristo Railroad, the location of the former community of Cutoff Junction, and the site of a former logging spur railroad. Artifacts of various kinds appear near the trail. Some are easily identified, including remnants of a cast iron stove, broken pieces of rotary saw blades, old bricks, and a bent length of steel rail. Many of these items are quite photogenic. Feel free to take photos, but please leave the artifacts for future hikers to enjoy.\n\nAt one point the trail turns up a side canyon, climbs just a few feet, then crosses to the other side. Soon, the lime kiln looms up rather abruptly on the right, a short way off the trail. It's about 20 feet tall, with considerable moss and ferns adorning the sides. The overall form of the kiln and the shape of the arch on the side first seen from the trail, combined with the very green mossy surroundings, invite comparisons to a Mayan jungle ruin.\n\nThe kiln was built in the 1890s and used until the early 1930s to convert local limestone into "lime," i.e. calcium oxide. The product was transported by the adjoining railroad, mostly for use as a "flux" to promote melting of ores in smelters in the Everett area. The limestone apparently was loaded into the open top of the kiln from carts that approached from the uphill side. Unfortunately, none of the loading structure remains. The kiln has stoking ports on three sides where fires would have been tended--gathering sufficient dry wood as fuel in this very moist area must have presented a challenge!\n\nBeyond the kiln, the trail follows the railroad grade upstream another 0.7 miles, where a sign directs hikers left for the 0.2 mile "River Shore Loop," or right for the "Railroad Bridge Site and End of Trail." Actually, you can go either way. Each branch of the trail loops back on the other, and part way around the loop there is a signed side trail that leads 150 feet to the site of the former bridge that once crossed the Stillaguamish, though nothing now remains of the bridge.\n\nThe loop trail does descend to the stony river bank for a close-up view of the water. In late summer or early fall the water level is low, the river flow is calm, and a bit of sandy beach may be exposed. But in winter or early spring the river can become a torrent and should be approached cautiously.	Maples, Alders, Conifers		From SR-92 in Granite Falls, turn south on Granite Avenue. It's the main cross street in the old part of town and has a four-way stop. Go three short blocks and turn left on Pioneer Street, which soon becomes Menzel Lake Road. In about 0.8 mile, turn left onto Waite Mill Road. In just over a half-mile, drive past a wide school bus turn-around and note on the left the sign for "Lime Kiln Trail." Head left on the gravel road and, in about 500 feet, turn left into the signed Robe Canyon Historic Park and reach the trailhead parking area.\n\nParking is free, and no passes or fees are required. There is room for, perhaps, 25 cars at the trailhead. Note that the access road shoulder is signed "No Parking." A portable toilet is available, but no water source.	http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/lime-kiln#trailhead-map
1288	9539	1		It is also an IBA (Important Bird Area)\nLaguna Blanca is located in central Paraguay, in North East San Pedro Department, 28km East of the town of Santa Rosa del Aguaray, a town 270 kilometers from Asunción (the capital city of Paraguay)\n	The area is a confluence of near pristine Cerrado, a patch of the Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest, the Cerrado and areas of transitional semi-deciduous, semi-humid forest. It has a mean elevation of 215 m with a slight ondulation. \nOn the lower areas formations are mostly open while on the higher terrain dense woody Myrtaceae shrubs of less than a meter are predominant. Fires occurrs almost anually.\n\nThe Atlantic Forest in Paraguay is very fragmented and few large remnants remain.  It is a humid forest where many species of plants, insects, mammals, and birds live, many of them are endemic to this area.  Some important plants are Alsophyla atrovirens, Ilex paraguariensis, Handroanthus heptaphyllus, and Peltophorum dubium. The atlantic forest is considered a hotspot for conservation. At least 81 bird species are endemic to the Atlantic forest in Paraguay.\n\n\nThe Cerrado is a diverse mosaic of habitats and natural communities, formed by savannah and dry forests. Several species are endemic to this area. In Paraguay, the cerrado is divided in: \n-campo limpio: native pasture with few if any trees\n- campo cerrado: savanah formations with different densities of forest cover\n- cerradon: densely covered with woody vegetation\n	The place is famous for its lake and also for the diversity of birds that can be observed in the area. 283 bird species have been registered for this area.\n\nThreatened Birds of Laguna Blanca \n\nLesser Nothura Nothura minor VU\nCrowned Eagle Harpyhaliaetus coronatus EN\nWhite-winged Nightjar Eleothreptus candicans EN\nHelmeted Woodpecker Dryocopus galeatus VU,\nSharp-tailed Grass-tyrant Culicivora caudacuta VU\nCock-tailed Tyrant Alecturus tricolour VU\nBare-necked Bellbird Procnias nudicollis VU\nBlack-masked Finch Coryphaspiza melanotis VU\nMarsh Seedeater Sporophila palustris EN\nChestnut Seedeater Sporophila cinnamomea VU\n\n\nNear-threatened Birds of Laguna Blanca \n\nGreater Rhea Rhea americana\nBearded Tachuri Polystictus pectoralis\nWhite-banded Tanager Neothraupis fasciatus\nDark-throated Seedeater Sporophila ruficollis\n	Laguna Blanca Ranch is privately owned and one must call before visitin because a limited number of people are allowed in the area in order to avoid exceeding the carrying capacity of the area. \nTo arrive on a clear day one can take a small car, otherwise a truck is needed.

1290	10475	1		This park is located inside two departments: Itapua ́and Caazapa.  It is found in the upper watershed of the Tebicuary river in the San Rafael hill range, with elevations ranging from 100 to 500 m.\n	The vegetation ranges from Atlantic Forest and Mesopotamian Grasslands ecosystems.\nIt is a transtition area where the humd tall forest give way to lower and drier forests.\nRain is common but falls mostly during October-February, and the average annual precipitation is 2,100 mm. Temperature is variable. The warmest period with an average 23.8 °C is October-April while the coldest period has an average of 17°C and is May-September.\n\n80% of the reserve is covered by forest, while grassland and wetland cover around 8% of the reserve, and 12% is covered by altered spaces (agricultural land).\nThere are rivers and streams inside the reserve as well as ponds and water channels made by men.\nThe area has a long history of suffering due to forest fire that lately has become better controlled. It is hypothezised that the Atlantic Forest of Paraguay could be suffering from "cerradization", that is, becoming a cerrado due to human activities, particularly fire; and the presence of a species in San Rafael that is typically associated with the Cerrado could hint that this process is happening here. \nThere are 437 species of birds living in this reserve, the largest number of birds in a protected area in this country.\nThis is a conflive area, considered that few areas inside it where owned by the government and there are still private landowners inside it, as well as indigenous communities, therefore the status as a reserve is debatable. However efforts are being made to make this area a special conservation area where indigenous rights will be taken into account.

1294	10504	1		The area of Seattle stretching north of the central business district from Stewart Street to Mercer Street is usually dubbed the Denny Regrade, acknowledging the area's forcible flattening by city engineers early in the twentieth century. It incorporates the older Belltown district, originally west of 2nd Avenue but today more broadly defined by its various denizens.\n\nThe area today combines artist lofts and hangouts with new highrises where condos and apartments are providing close-in housing. Following the new, mostly affluent residents, a number of upscale restaurants and clubs have established a brisk trade in the area. The result, at least for the time being, is a yeasty combination of the bohemian and the trendy, with a significant nightlife.\n\nA City Engineer and His Nemesis\n\nThe generally flat terrain of today's Regrade was originally a steep hill named Denny Hill, but that was changed by a mammoth construction project in the first decades of the twentieth century. A motivating force was Reginald Heber Thomson (1856-1949), who became Seattle's city engineer in 1892. He designed the town's first modern sewers and established a water system that a century later remains the region's largest. But roads and boulevards were Thomson's first love, especially straight and level roads and boulevards. Thus, Seattle's topography presented the Scots-Irish engineer with a daunting challenge, and no irregularity of nature affronted him more than Denny Hill.\n\nThe hill rose steeply north of Pine Street between 2nd and 5th avenues and then descended gradually to the north across the land claim of William Bell (1817-1887). It was defined on the west with a precipitous bluff that dropped from 2nd Avenue to the edge of Elliott Bay. This confined "Belltown" to 1st and Western avenues and largely isolated it from the downtown precincts to the south. (Bell left Seattle in 1855 and actually had little to do with his namesake land claim.)\n\nDenny Hill stuck in R. H. Thomson's craw because he believed it blocked the city's manifest destiny of northward expansion. Having seen the power of hydraulic mining in California, he knew that the hill could easily be sluiced into the bay, but he was frustrated by the stubborn ambition of Arthur Denny (1822-1899) to lure the territorial legislature to his own "Capitol Hill" (not to be confused with the present-day hill northeast of downtown).\n\nFinally persuaded in 1889 that the seat of the new state government was firmly planted in Olympia, Denny began to erect an enormous hotel, which he named for himself. The Panic of 1893 halted work before the interior had been completed, leaving the turreted Victorian shell of the Denny Hotel to hover over Seattle's landscape for a decade, abandoned at the altar of Denny's great expectations.\n\nJames A. Moore, a flamboyant developer in his own right, bought and completed the 100-room pile as the Washington Hotel. He personally handed the first guest keys to President Teddy Roosevelt (1858-1919) and his entourage on May 23, 1903. Moore built his own tram to transport guests to the top of Denny Hill and started building his own namesake theater and hotel on its western slope.\n\nRegrading Moore's High Expectations\n\nThomson started nibbling at Denny Hill's flanks while working on the perhaps more difficult project of wearing down Moore's resolve. Economics finally convinced Moore to abandon the high ground in 1906. He erected a modern New Washington Hotel (now the Josephinium) at 2nd Avenue and Stewart Street.\n\nThomson wasted no time tearing into Denny Hill, but it took five years to vanquish his topographical foe west of 5th Avenue. (The rest of the eastern slope was regraded in 1929 and 1930.) When property owners balked at selling, engineers carved around their lots, sometimes leaving houses stranded a hundred feet in air atop "spite mounds." These man-made buttes fell by 1911, giving Seattle a vast new tabula rasa upon which to sketch its urban visions.\n\nThe first and most famous vision was drawn by Virgil Bogue (1846-1916), a protégé of the Olmsted brothers (whom Seattle had retained in 1903 to plan its park system). The Municipal Plans Commission hired Bogue in 1910, and he delivered a comprehensive plan the following year. Reading like a manifesto of the City Beautiful movement, the Bogue plan proposed to remake Seattle in the image of the "Civic Idea ... a consciousness demanding the recognition of organic unity and intelligent system."\n\nThese words were given flesh in his design for a new Civic Center, an ensemble of Beaux-Arts government buildings, not unlike San Francisco's City Hall complex, radiating outward from the intersection of 4th Avenue and Blanchard Street. The plan basically relocated downtown Seattle to the new Regrade, which horrified property owners south of Pine Street and precipitated a bitter battle between reformers, led by Thomson, and the "landlord trust."\n\nVoters Nix Bogue Plan\n\nDivided, confused, and wary of the potential bill for Bogue's dream -- which included a rapid transit tunnel from downtown to Kirkland on the far shore of Lake Washington and the purchase of Mercer Island as a city park -- voters rejected the plan in 1912 by nearly two to one.\n\nThomson's blank slate remained mostly blank for the next half century, thanks to two key factors. First, the automobile, barely mentioned in Bogue's plan, facilitated the city's rapid expansion into outlying areas and obviated the Regrade's original raison d'etre to serve horse-drawn vehicles stalled by Seattle's steep hills. Second, skyscrapers such as the new Smith Tower, which City Beautiful planners despised, allowed owners to concentrate business development (and raise property values) within the existing downtown.\n\nServiceable But Seedy\n\nHotels, apartments, warehouses, and car dealerships slowly filled the Regrade's vacant lots with functional but largely undistinguished structures. The cheap land attracted marginal businesses to service the downtown. Labor unions raised meeting halls and a Central Labor Temple at 1st Avenue and Broad Street. Film distributors dotted the area with ornate "jewel box" auditoriums in which to preview new releases for theater owners from throughout the Northwest. The older strip of Belltown west of 2nd Avenue fell into disrepair and disrepute as an upland adjunct to the harbor and a berth for visiting sailors.\n\nSeattle's Soho\n\nThe Regrade's modest success as a working-class neighborhood fell far short of Thomson's and Bogue's lofty ambitions, but this did not dissuade succeeding generations of planners and developers from fantasizing "better" futures for the area. The next major step was taken in the mid-1970s when the City approved new zoning to encourage construction of a high-rise residential district. Reality again disappointed the planners, and young artists, musicians, and entrepreneurs took advantage of the area's low rents to establish a thriving mini-Soho colony of studios, galleries, cafes, and clubs.\n\nIn the early 1980s, developer Martin Selig launched a one-man boom of new office construction in the area. The condo craze and superheated real estate market of the Reagan years promoted more construction -- and nearly bankrupted a few developers when the tax reform of 1986 popped their financial bubbles. A new round of high-rise construction and rising property values threaten to drive out the Regrade and Belltown's surviving bohemian element. But, as of the late 1990s at least, the artistic feel continues to mingle with the upscale restaurants and clubs that are serving the many new residents.

It is located on the Mountain Loop Highway eleven miles east of Granite Falls and is part of the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The center was constructed by the CCC during the Great Depression and the building reflects the architectural style of that time. The building houses a museum, and maps, weather and hiking information, books, and park passes are available. Nearby popular trails include the Big Four Ice Caves and Mount Pilchuck.

1298	10651	1		The curiously-named Lake Twentytwo is the center of an oasis of alpine wetland nestled on the northern shoulder of Mount Pilchuck. The hike to the lake combines the best of mountain rainforests, old-growth, wetlands, and mountain views, yet it is readily accessible. In winter the route lends itself to snowshoeing.\n\nThe origin of Lake Twentytwo’s distinct name is uncertain, but a leading theory is that nineteenth-century railroad maps listed local creeks numerically; one particular creek and its source lake were assigned “22.” The name stuck, and in 1947 the 790-acre Lake Twenty Two Research Natural Area (RNA) was created, putting an end to logging and allowing future generations to appreciate the remaining old-growth cedars and hemlocks.\n\nAt the trailhead, set out on a well-maintained track that quickly becomes a mountain rainforest trail. Substantial effort has gone into building a trail that can withstand the perpetual beating from the arch-enemy of all trails, water. Gravel, turnpikes, stone steps, puncheon bridges, and more turnpikes make a sustainable trail surface possible. There is always "water on trail" here, but the dampness allows ferns and moss to flourish in the Mountain Loop rainforest, and provides a trail environment fascinating to little ones.\n\nThe trail climbs steadily through the forest of western hemlock, mountain hemlock, alder, and red cedar. Old-growth hemlock and cedar giants have managed to persist due to the RNA. Substantial segments of the lower trail cross active creekbeds, so plan on wearing footwear appropriate for fording small creeks. At 0.6 miles, there is a bridge crossing over Twentytwo Creek, giving your boots a break from keeping your feet dry. But the ample water supply keeps salmonberry, thimbleberry, bunchberry, arnica, and bleeding heart growing thick all along the way. You are never far from the rush of water, and several waterfalls are located close to the trail.\n\nAt 1.5 miles, leave the forest and climb a talus slope, where western columbine makes an appearance in the summer. This middle segment offers views of Whitehorse Mountain and Three Fingers on clear days. Trudging onward, reenter the forest at 2.1 miles. Shortly thereafter, the terrain takes on a wetland character, with skunk cabbage blooming in the spring. When you reach the bridge over Lake Twentytwo's outflow, you have traveled 2.7 miles through lush rainforest. Marvel at the sheer northern face of Mount Pilchuck, with its waterfalls and (sometimes) booming avalanches in winter and spring. Take in the reflections of rock, sky, and evergreens on the surface of a pristine alpine cirque.\n\nWTA Pro-Tip: Though it may seem like you can make a circuit of the lake, it's best not to attempt this. The boulder field can be tricky, even dangerous, to navigate and fatalities have occurred.

1299	10668	1		The Interurban Trail (North) runs for 25 miles between Everett, Washington, in the north and the Seattle neighborhoods of Bitter Lake and Greenwood in the south. The trail—which is not to be confused with the more southerly trail of the same name stretching between Tukwila, Pacific and Fife—follows the old right-of-way used by the Seattle-Everett Interurban, which connected the two cities in the early 20th century.\n\nThe trail is a popular commuting route through an urban landscape north of Seattle. The busy trail links many businesses and neighborhoods, and even features a direct connection to the Everett Mall at SE Everett Mall Way. Most of the trail is off-road but there are a few designated bike routes on-road; signs will guide you. A long segment of the trail parallels Interstate 5. Despite the asphalt surface, the trail accommodates horseback riders on certain segments in Snohomish County.

The area under consideration (in the following designated as “interest area”) is only a small portion on the lower southeast slopes of this mountain. It comprises a core of very steep, south and southeast-facing open bluffs overlooking the Koksilah River valley and a surrounding forested buffer.\nThe open bluff area is approximately halved by a west-east running boundary, with Weyerhaeuser Company private land to the north and west and with Ministry of Forests crown land to the south and east. Koksilah River Provincial Park extends to the south and east beyond the Ministry of Forests land.\n	In this relatively small interest area there is excellent representation of forest communities in various stages of succession, including early stages after logging, early and mid-seral stages naturally established after wild fires, and old growth forest. Open bluffs support a variety of moss/lichen and grassland communities as well as woodland communities which cover the transitional habitats between openings and the closed forest. 	\nResults of the forays of Pacific Northwest Key Council (Oct. 30, 1999), South Vancouver Island Mycological Society (1998-2000) and field trips by Oluna Ceska (1998-2002), altogether about 12 visits.

1303	10758	1		Isle Royale /ˌaɪl ˈrɔɪ.əl/[1] is an island of the Great Lakes, located in the northwest of Lake Superior, and part of the U.S. state of Michigan. The island and the 450 surrounding smaller islands and waters make up Isle Royale National Park.[2]\n\nThe island is 45 miles (72 km) long and 9 miles (14 km) wide, with an area of 206.73 square miles (535.43 km2), making it the largest natural island in Lake Superior, the second largest island in the Great Lakes (after Manitoulin Island), the third largest in the contiguous United States (after Long Island and Padre Island), and the 33rd largest island in the United States. It is defined by the United States Census Bureau as Census Tract 9603 of Keweenaw County, Michigan. As of the 2000 census there was no permanent population.[3] After the island was made a national park, some existing residents were allowed to stay,[4] and a few leases are still in effect. Ferries from Michigan and Minnesota land at Rock Harbor on the eastern end of the island; this has a lodge, campground, and information center. Ferries from Minnesota also run to Windigo on the western end, which has a visitor center and campground.\n\nIn 1875, Isle Royale was set off from Keweenaw County, as a separate county, "Isle Royale County". In 1897, the county was dissolved, and the island was reincorporated into Keweenaw County. The highest point on the island is Mount Desor at 1,394 feet (425 m), or about 800 feet (240 m) above lake level.\n\nIsle Royale is within about 15 miles (24 km) of the Canadian and Minnesotan shores of the lake, (near the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario), and is 56 miles (90 km) from the Michigan shore, on the Keweenaw Peninsula. There are seasonal passenger ferry services to the island from Grand Portage, Minnesota; Copper Harbor, Michigan; and Houghton, Michigan. There is also a seasonal sea plane service. There are no roads on the island, and, in fact, no wheeled vehicles or devices, other than wheelchairs, are permitted.[5] Rock Harbor does have wheeled carts available to move personal belongings from the Rock Harbor marina to the cabins and hotel. Also the National Park Service does employ tractors and a few WWII jeeps to move items around the ranger station area at Windigo, Rock Harbor, and Mott Island.\n\nTopsoil tends to be thin, which favors trees that have horizontal root patterns such as balsam fir, white spruce and black spruce.\nInterior lakes\n\nSiskiwit Lake is the largest lake on the island. It has cold, clear water which is relatively low in nutrients. Siskiwit Lake contains several islands, including Ryan Island, the largest, which contains Moose Flats, a seasonal pond, which contains Moose Boulder. When Moose Flats is a pond, Moose Boulder becomes the largest island in the largest lake on the largest island in the largest lake on the largest island in the largest lake in the world.[6]\n\n    Chicken Bone Lake\n    Lake Desor\n    Feldtmann Lake\n    Intermediate Lake (Isle Royale)\n    Lake Ritchie\n    Sargent Lake\n\nGeology\n[icon] \tThis section requires expansion. (May 2008)\nCross-section of the Lake Superior basin showing the tilted strata of volcanic rock that form Isle Royale\n\nThe island is composed largely of ridges, running roughly southwest-to-northeast. The main ridge, Greenstone Ridge, is over 1,000 feet (300 m) in many places. Greenstone belts are exposed, with rounded stones of chlorastrolite or greenstone near and in the Lake.\nMODIS image of Isle Royale\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, the North sides of the ridges tend to be steeper than the south sides. Coastal areas were once submerged beneath prehistoric lake waters, and contain many tumbled boulders and other large rocks.\n\nThe island was a common hunting ground for native peoples from nearby Minnesota and Ontario. A canoe voyage of only thirteen miles is necessary to reach the island's west end from the mainland.\n\nIn prehistoric times, large quantities of copper were mined on Isle Royale and the nearby Keweenaw Peninsula. The region is scarred by ancient mine pits and trenches up to 20 feet deep. Carbon-14 testing of wood remains found in sockets of copper artifacts indicates that they are at least 5700 years old. In Prehistoric Copper Mining in the Lake Superior Region, published in 1961, Drier and Du Temple estimated that over 750,000 tons of copper had been mined from the region. However, David Johnson and Susan Martin contend that their estimate was based on exaggerated and inaccurate assumptions.[7][8]\n\nIsle Royale was given to the United States by the 1783 treaty with Great Britain, but the British remained in control until after the War of 1812, and the Ojibwa peoples considered the island to be their territory. The Ojibwas ceded the island to the U.S. in the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe, with the Grand Portage Band unaware that neither they nor Isle Royale were in British territory. With the clarification to the Ojibwas of the 1842 Webster–Ashburton Treaty that was signed before the Treaty of La Pointe, the Ojibwas re-affirmed the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe in the 1844 Isle Royale Agreement, with the Grand Portage Band signing the agreement as an addendum to the 1842 treaty.\n\nIn the mid-1840s, a report by Douglass Houghton, Michigan's first state geologist, set off a copper boom in the state, and the first modern copper mines were opened on the island.[9] Evidence of the earlier mining efforts was everywhere, in the form of many stone hammers, some copper artifacts, and places where copper had been partially worked out of the rock but left in place. The ancient pits and trenches led to the discovery of many of the copper deposits that were mined in the 19th century.[7] The remoteness of the island, combined with the small veins of copper, caused most of the 19th century mines to fail quickly.[citation needed] Between the miners and commercial loggers, much of the island was deforested during the late 19th century. Once the island became a National Park in 1940, logging and other exploitive activities ended, and the forest began to regenerate.\n\nThe island was once the site of several lake trout and whitefish fisheries, as well as a few resorts. Today, it has no permanent inhabitants; the small communities of Scandinavian fishermen were removed by the United States Park Service after the island became a national park in the 1930s. There are still about 12 families that have life-time leases for their cabins and claim Isle Royale as their heritage, and several descendant fishermen still fish the Isle Royale waters commercially.[4] The western tip of the island is home to several shipwrecks that are very popular with scuba divers, including the SS America.[10] The NPS Submerged Resources Center mapped the 10 most famous of the shipwrecks contained within the park, and published Shipwrecks of Isle Royale National Park; The Archeological Survey,[11] which gives an overview of the maritime history of the area.\nRecreational activities\nBeach near mouth of Washington Creek\n\nRecreational activity on Isle Royale includes hiking, fishing, boating, kayaking, and observing nature. The island is covered in wilderness trails, some of which are quite challenging, with steep grades. No wheeled vehicles are permitted on Isle Royale, including bicycles or canoe portage devices, however wheelchairs are allowed.[12]\n\nThere are numerous campgrounds, many of which are only accessible by water. There are only two small settlements on the island proper: Rock Harbor, which has a resort, a marina, and basic amenities, and Windigo, a smaller facility on the far western end of the island. Both have pay showers and food available\n\nA typical National Park Service campground consists of a small number of shelters (cabin-like structures with one wall of mosquito-proof screen), individual tent sites with picnic table, and group camping sites. There are one or more pit toilets at each facility. Campgrounds along the shore have a boat dock and overnight boaters are a common sight at some campgrounds. Waterfront locations also attract canoeists and kayakers. No wells are available, thus all water is usually filtered or thoroughly boiled to prevent infection by parasites and bacteria.\nBeach at Huginnin Cove camp area\nView from the top of Mount Franklin looking north\nHiking\n\nThe island offers approximately 170 miles (270 km) of hiking trails for everything from day hikes to a two-week circumnavigation hike.[13] "The most popular, best marked and longest single route ...is the 40-mile Greenstone Ridge Trail that extends down the island's backbone."[13] The trail leads to the peak of Mount Desor, at 1,394 feet (425 m), the highest point on the island and also passes though northwoods wilderness, and by inland glacial lakes, swamps, bogs and scenic shorelines.[13]\nEcology\n\nA number of habitats exist on the island, the primary being boreal forest, similar to neighboring Ontario and Minnesota. Upland areas along some of the ridges are effectively "balds" with exposed bedrock and a few scrubby trees, blueberry bushes, and hardy grasses. Occasional marshes exist, which are typically the by-product of beaver activities. There are also several lakes, often with wooded or marshy shores. The climate, especially in lowland areas, is heavily influenced by the cold waters of Lake Superior.\n\nThe island is well known among ecologists as the site of a long-term study of a predator-prey system, between moose and eastern timber wolves. There is a cyclical relationship between the two animals: as the moose increase in population, so do the wolves. Eventually, the wolves kill too many moose and begin to starve and lower their reproductive rates. However, the introduction of canine parvovirus by a visitor's illegal dog to the wolf population led to steep declines in the early 1980s. Dogs, cats, and other pets were then - and still are, banned from Isle Royale specifically to prevent the introduction of diseases to the wolf population.[14]\nSee also: Wolves and Moose on Isle Royale\n\nBefore the self-introduction of wolves to the island (crossing winter ice from Ontario), coyotes were the primary predators for a time. Prior to that, the lynx dominated, preying on caribou and snowshoe hares. Human activities wiped out both the lynx and caribou, but some hares remain. Other common mammals are red foxes, beavers, and red squirrels. Some foxes are quite used to human contact, and can be seen prowling the campgrounds at dawn, looking for stray scraps left by unwary campers. For its part, the wolf is an elusive species which avoids human interaction. Few documented cases of direct wolf/human contact exist. Ermine have been periodically sighted around docks. Other mammals that can be seen include mink (along the various lake shores) and muskrats (occasionally at beaver ponds). Several species of bat also exist on the island.[15] Reptiles include the eastern garter snake, painted turtle, and northern redbelly snake.[16] Six species of frogs and three species of salamander also live on the island.[17]\nTravel to Isle Royale\nIsle Royale Queen IV at Copper Harbor\n\nThe island is accessible by private boat, seaplane, National Park Service ferry service from Houghton, Michigan, (the Ranger III[18]), ferry service from Copper Harbor, Michigan, (Isle Royale Queen IV), and ferry service from Grand Portage, Minnesota, (Voyageur II and Sea Hunter). Scheduled ferry service runs May through September.[13] The park is open to the public from April 16 until October 31; full services are offered mid-June through Labor Day.[13] In 2008, visitors were given the option to embark/depart the NPS ship Ranger III at Windigo, on the far western end of the island. This proved to be a failure due to the extremely long boat ride and lack of ridership and was discontinued after only four trips				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_Royale
1304	10770	1		Bitter Lake Playfield is a fun neighborhood park that features lighted tennis courts, lighted ball fields, a wading pool, whirl, and play structure.\n\nBitter Lake was formed by the “Vashon Ice Sheet” (50,000 years ago). The lake is presently spring fed. Bitter Lake obtained its name due to the presence of tannic acid and its history as a holding pond for logs by the sawmill which was located on the west shore. In 1930 a “Playland” was developed privately consisting of amusement rides. In 1968 a Supreme Court Decision ordered a half-built apartment complex be removed from the lake area: all water oriented rights must be shared without interference among all owners of lake.				http://www.seattle.gov/parks/park_detail.asp?id=288

It is at the west end of the central valley and is on the NW slopes of Poas Volcano.  It covers a little over 1 square mile which include the headwaters of the Sarchi and Trojas Rivers on the Pacific side and Gorrion River on the Caribbean side.  	Cloud Forest with dominant oak tree species.  Most of this property has been in recuperation from eroded dairy cow pasture for 12 years, beginning in 2002.  Now most of it has cover with giant ferns, various Melastomatacea, Galtheria and Vaccinum.  Alder has been planted on the pacific slopes to provide some shade for the regenerating species.		From Sarchi one can access San Jose de Trojas.  Finca Dos Lados is at the end of the road about 6 km above Trojas.  The last couple of km one need 4 wheel drive if one is driving.  You can always walk.  The finca is happy to host researchers in Restoration Ecology and all that that entails.

1342	11175	1		Maplewell Farm lies between Lingdale Golf Club and Maplewell Road, close to Woodhouse Eaves. Although it is private land, there is a public footpath that runs through the farm and which forms part of numerous walkways through the Charnwood Forest region of Leicestershire, just northwest of Leicester.	The farmland seems to be used largely for cattle and sheep grazing. The soil seems to have a high clay and chalk content, which is evident on the farm roads and walkways.\nAside from regular english hedgerows, largely consisting of hawthorn, there are regular oak and beech trees around the area.	Boletus Radicans	Private farm with public walkways. Farm is accessed via a nearby golf course or from Maplewell Road running into Woodhouse Eaves, Leicestershire. 	
1343	11171	1		Staunton Harold Reservoir is located on the southernmost border of Derbyshire County and some of the water falls into Leicestershire County. Surrounding grounds are part of the Calke Abbey estate, which falls under the custodianship of the National Trust. The rest of the surroundings are part of the National Forest.	The surrounding area has many walkways and has a variety of mature deciduous trees. There are plenty of brambles and some bracken.	Amanita, Boletus, Piptoporus, Lycoperdon	Public access. Pay-and-display parking lot available.	
1344	11169	1		Beacon hill is the second highest peak in Leicestershire (814 ft). It is located outside Loughborough to the north-west of Leicester city in the United Kingdom.	The surrounding area is a country park of around 330 acres, consisting of a mixture of grassland and woodland. Spread across some steep and rocky walks.\nThe rocks are igneous and volcanic resulting from a pre-cambrian volcanic fault-line that runs from Leicestershire across to Germany. Soil tends to be rich in clay.\nThere are a variety of deciduous and native tree species. Many oak, beech and birch trees are present.\nThere is a fair amount of bracken growing in the grasslands.	Amanita Muscaria grow in abundance.\nScleroderma Citrinum (Common Earthballs) are also frequent.\nClitocybes, Russula, Mycena, Xylaria, Piptoporus etc have all been identified in the area.

1345	11176	1		Ambion Wood is located along the Ashby canal that stretches from Dadlington through Sutton Cheney and up to Shenton and finally Market Bosworth in Leicestershire.\nThe wood is accessed along a canal path that runs from Sutton Cheney wharf to a point near the Bosworth Battle Heritage Centre.\n	Trees in the area are mostly conifers with the presence of a number of oak and  \nhazel trees. \nThe ground is rich with a thick layer of humus from a very mature forest, however surrounding area indicates lots of damp clay.\nMoss is plentiful in the woods as are brambles.\n\nA 1986 BBC reference, provided below, indicates that the forest was largely oak and hazel, but was suffering from dutch elm disease. This may indicate why it is largely a conifer forest today.	Boletus, Lactarius, Cortinarius and many Psathyrella are present. 	Although the woodlands themselves are private, the path running through the woods is a public footpath that connects Sutton Cheney to the the Bosworth Heritage Centre. Pay and display parking is available at both locations. It is generally cheaper to park at Sutton Cheney wharf.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-440000-297000/page/6
1346	11188	1		I don't know if this area has an official name, but I'm calling it Kingfisher Canyon after the name of the name of the neighborhood that is located here. The official name of this coastal canyon, if it has one, may or may not be Harford Canyon. I don't know anyone who knows! If I ever find out I will edit the name here.	Very mild microclimate sheltered from the prevailing winds and fog. There aren't usually temperature extremes, and frost is rare. As the crow flies this area is about 2-1/2 miles inland from the Avila Beach pier and San Luis bay. In the canyon itself it is woodland dominated by Quercus agrifolia (Coastal Live Oak) with Platanus racemosa (California Sycamore) in the riparian areas (seasonal creeks and waterfalls). Ascending the canyon hills there is Arctostaphylos, and the oak woodland begins to mix increasingly with the coastal scrub community typical of the Central Coast.

1355	11341	1		Wallingford is a neighborhood in north central Seattle, Washington, named after John Noble Wallingford, Jr. (1833–1913).[1][2] The QFC supermarket at the corner of N 45th Street and Wallingford Avenue N may be regarded as the center of the neighborhood; its large WALLINGFORD neon sign[3] is made in part from letters in the old FOOD GIANT sign that adorned QFC's predecessor for decades, into the late 1990s.[4][5]\nWallingford Sign\n\nJohn Wallingford was a major local landowner and real estate speculator; at one time his holdings included most of what is now Wallingford and extended north as far as Green Lake. He travelled considerably up and down the West Coast of the United States and lived for a time in Alaska.\n\nWallingford's business district extends along N 45th Street from Stone Way N in the west to Sunnyside Avenue N in the east and features many small shops, three banks, a pharmacy, a few taverns and bars, the two Guild 45th movie theaters, the Wallingford Center (the former Interlake Elementary School, now turned into shops and apartments), and numerous restaurants (including the original Dick's Drive-In, founded 1954).\n\nPublic spaces include Gas Works Park,[6] Meridian Playground, and Wallingford playfield. Gas Works Park on Lake Union borders the Burke-Gilman Trail and provides a panoramic extension into Lake Union, with a playground in planning as part of the 2009 parks levy. Meridian playground features a former Roman Catholic home for wayward girls called the Good Shepherd Center, now a shared community space run by Historic Seattle. Major tenants include Seattle Tilth, Meridian School, the Wallingford Senior Center, and the Chapel performance space which features the Wayward Music Series . Wallingford playfield borders recently renovated Hamilton International Middle School and features views and a wading pool open in summer months. To the north lies Lower Woodland Park, which features athletic fields, a skate park, tennis courts, and connections to the Woodland Park Zoo and Green Lake. The University of Wallingford began in 1984, to provide religious training and Social Gospel Care to the neighborhood. It is located in the Seattle First Church of the Nazarene, behind Dick's on 45th.\n\nWallingford is home to several community organizations. The Wallingford Neighborhood Office, located behind Tully's (now closed -- new occupant TBD on the northeast corner of Meridian Avenue N and N 45th street) helps organize local events. The Wallingford Community Council meets the first Wednesday every month in the Good Shepherd Center and engages the community with government organizations. Sustainable Wallingford is a residents group dedicated to sustainable living. Seattle Tilth runs the public gardens and plant sales at the Good Shepherd Center. Solid Ground (formerly The Fremont Public Association) is colocated with the Wallingford Branch of the Seattle Public Library and runs a food bank and family support services. The Wallingford Boys and Girls club provides a safe, social space for kids and teens along 45th, while the Wallingford Senior Center provides a safe social space for older folks.\n\nJust south of N 45th is the former (Abraham) Lincoln High School (1907–1981), now used primarily to house public schools "in exile" while their own buildings undergo major renovations: Ballard High School was rebuilt in 1997–1999, Roosevelt High School (Seattle) in 2004–2006, Hamilton Middle School in 2008–2010, and McDonald / John Hay Elementary Schools beginning in 2010.\n\nLike neighboring Fremont (and, indeed, most Seattle neighborhoods), Wallingford's boundaries are not fixed, but they may be thought of as Stone Way N to the west, beyond which is Fremont; Lake Union to the south; Interstate 5 to the east, beyond which is the University District; and Woodland Park and NE 60th St. to the north, beyond which is Green Lake.\n\nA secondary concentration of mostly retail businesses on N 55th Street near Meridian Avenue is known variously as Tangletown or Meridian and considered by some to be more closely associated with Greenlake than Wallingford. The likely source for the name Tangletown is the irregular configuration of the blocks, some of which follow the contours of Green Lake, others conforming to the city's basic grid. Meridian sometimes refers to a wider neighborhood than Tangletown, which refers strictly to the retail district. The region south of N 40th Street is also known as Northlake or SoFo (South of Fortieth).\n\nMajor annual events in the neighborhood include the Wallingford Kiddie Parade as part of Seafair, the Wallingford Wurst Festival run by St Benedict's Church, and the Family Fourth fireworks show at Gas Works Park. Smaller events include Seattle Tilth's chicken coop tour and the Wallingford Neighborhood office's garden and home tours.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Seattle
1356	11398	1		Fremont is a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington. Originally a separate city, it was annexed to Seattle in 1891, and is named after Fremont, Nebraska, the hometown of two of its founders Luther H. Griffith and Edward Blewett.\n\nIt is situated along the Fremont Cut of the Lake Washington Ship Canal to the north of Queen Anne, the east of Ballard, the south of Phinney Ridge, and the southwest of Wallingford. Its boundaries are not formally fixed, but they can be thought of as consisting of the Ship Canal to the south, Stone Way N. to the east, N. 50th Street to the north, and 8th Avenue N.W. to the west.\n\nThe neighborhood's main thoroughfares are Fremont and Aurora Avenues N. (north- and southbound) and N. 46th, 45th, 36th, and 34th Streets (east- and westbound). The Aurora Bridge (George Washington Memorial Bridge) carries Aurora Avenue (State Route 99) over the Ship Canal to the top of Queen Anne Hill, and the Fremont Bridge carries Fremont Avenue over the canal to the hill's base. A major shopping district is centered on Fremont Avenue N. just north of the bridge.\n\nSometimes referred to as "The People's Republic of Fremont"[2] or "The Artists' Republic of Fremont,"[3][4] and at one time a center of the counterculture, Fremont has become somewhat gentrified in recent years.[5][6] The neighborhood remains home to a controversial statue of Vladimir Lenin salvaged from Slovakia by a local art lover who was teaching in the area at the time. After the 1989 fall of the Communist government, he brought the statue to Fremont with money raised through a mortgage on his house.[4] In addition to Lenin is the Fremont Troll, an 18-foot-tall (5 m) concrete sculpture of a troll crushing a Volkswagen Beetle in its left hand, created in 1990 and situated under the north end of the Aurora Bridge.[7] The street running under the bridge and ending at the Troll was renamed Troll Avenue N. in 2005.[8]\n\nIn addition, signs throughout Fremont give advice such as: "set your watch back five minutes," "set your watch forward five minutes," and "throw your watch away."[9] Other landmarks include the Fremont Rocket, a Fairchild C-119 tail boom modified to resemble a missile,[10] and the outdoor sculpture Waiting for the Interurban.[11]\n\nSince the early 1970s some Fremont residents have been referring to their neighborhood as "The Center of the Universe"[12] (which also appears on a large "Welcome" sign [13]). An unofficial motto "De Libertas Quirkas" ("Freedom to be Peculiar") appears in brochures and websites about the area.[10]\n\nThe Fremont Arts Council sponsors several highly attended annual events in Fremont. One of those events is the Summer Solstice Parade & Pageant, which has made Fremont famous for its nude Solstice Cyclists. Another event is the Troll-a-ween.\n\nAlso important to Fremont is the large block on Linden Avenue N. that contains the B.F. Day Elementary School and B.F. Day Playground, two separate entities. B.F. Day is the longest continually operating school in the Seattle school district, having been founded in 1892.[14]\n\nAnother longstanding institution is the Fremont branch of the Seattle Public Library. An informal library predated the 1891 annexation of Fremont to Seattle, and annexation made it the city's first branch library.[15] The present structure dates from 1921.\n\nBesides the B.F. Day playfield, Fremont has two small public parks, Fremont Peak Park just south of N. 45th Street and A.B. Ernst Park next to the library. The Burke-Gilman Trail passes through Fremont just north of the Lake Washington Ship Canal. The large Gas Works Park is just east of Fremont on the north shore of Lake Union.\n\nAdobe Systems' Seattle offices, Tableau Software's headquarters, BEA Systems' Seattle office, golf and daywear label Cutter & Buck's corporate headquarters. The Fremont has several breweries including Hale's Ales brewery and the Fremont Brewing. The original Redhook breweries were located in Fremont until their closures in 1988 and 2002, respectively. Google opened offices there in 2006, and the parent company of Geocaching.com is headquartered in Fremont.\n\nA growing number of technology companies have offices in Fremont, including Adobe Systems, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Google, SDL PLC, Groundspeak, Impinj, Sporcle, and Tableau Software. Most of these offices are along the Lake Washington Ship Canal.\n\nThe neighborhood is home to a number of nonprofit organizations, including Literacy Source and Provail, a provider of social services to people with disabilities and an affiliate of the United Cerebral Palsy network.\n\nA wedge-shaped building on the diagonal street Leary Way that cuts across Fremont from the adjacent Ballard neighborhood was once home to legendary Seattle producer Jack Endino's Reciprocal Recording studio, where he recorded (among many other records) Nirvana's first demos and the band's debut on Sub Pop records, Bleach.				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont,_Seattle
1357	11361	1		Which East River Trail?  \nThere are several trails along the East River in the Green Bay area. The longest and what is considered the “main” trail runs from the corner of Mason and Hartung in Green Bay (north end) to Ledgeview Park in Ledgeview (south end) for a length of about 8 miles. Another trail section runs from the north side of Mason St. just west of the river to Baird St. and is about .8 miles long. There is also a trail running from Boyd St. in Allouez to Cass St. in Green Bay which is approximately .9 miles.  \n\nMain Trail Section (approximately 8 miles)\nThis trail section is a pleasant winding trail closely following the contours of the East River through the communities of Green Bay, Bellevue, Allouez, De Pere and Ledgeview. The initial section of the trail from Green Isle Park in Allouez to Le Brun Streen in De Pere was developed in 1990 with the generous financial support of local businessman, Dick Resch. \n\nA southern extension of about one mile into De Pere and Ledgeview was added in 2004. Two additional extensions have been added since. A small trail section in Bellevue is routed through village sidewalks in order to go around elevated train tracks. The total length of the trail from the south end in Ledgeview to the north end in Green Bay is about 8 miles. From the north trailhead you can cross over Mason St. heading north and connect with another trail section on the west side of the East River which runs behind East High School and terminates \non Baird St. Baird Street/Mason Street Section (approximately .8 miles)\n\nStarting from Baird Street near the East river in Green Bay and proceeding south, this trail section passes behind East High School’s legendary City Stadium where the Packers played from 1925-1956. It then passes around Joannes Park and through Meyer Park terminating at Mason St. Continuing across Mason St. heading east, you can connect with the main trail.\n\nCass Street/Boyd Street Section (approximately .9 miles) \nStarting from Cass Street near the river in Green Bay heading south, this trail section follows along the west side of the East River through large park areas to Boyd Street in Allouez	Riparian area with ash, cottonwood, alder and buckthorn as well as shrubs. There are several cattail ponds, parks, grasslands and a few replanted prairies. Also an occasional industrial area, especially near the downtown or old railroad grade.	Sulpher shelf, russulas, elm oysters, giant puddballs, ganoderma	Private property more than five feet off the trails with the exception of the parks. Many of the parks managed to prevent fires so woody debris is not allowed to accumulate. In some areas a bobcat is brought in annually so mycellial growth and plants dependent upon it such as wild ginger have gone the way of burdock and buckthorn. \n\nSome parts of the trail, especially towards the south end, flood 1-2 days after heavy rains and are impassable without wading.	http://www.foxrivertrail.com/ert/\n\nhttp://whoonew.com/2014/07/east-river-trail/

1359	1829	1		Hickory Run State Park is a 15,990-acre (6,471 ha) Pennsylvania state park in Kidder and Penn Forest Townships in Carbon County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The park is spread across the Pocono Mountains. The park is easily accessible from Interstate 476 and Interstate 80.\nHickory Run State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of "Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks".	About 20,000 years ago, a giant sheet of ice\nat least one mile thick straddled Hickory\nRun. The western part of the park, including\nHickory Run Lake, was underneath the\nglacier. The land to the east is higher and\nwas not covered by the glacier, but was\ngreatly affected by the cold climate. Boulder\nField was created in this unglaciated area.\nThe western side of the park is covered in\nthe end moraine of the glacier. Like a giant\nbulldozer, the glacier scraped the land, and\nrocks, sand and other debris was pushed\nalong and frozen to the glacier. When the\nglacier melted and retreated, this debris was\ndropped, making a landscape of bogs and\nglacial till called a moraine.\nThe rocky soil of the area is called glacial\ntill. The steep valleys of the western side\nof the park were carved by the billions of\ngallons of water that streamed away from\nthe melting glacier. To see the change in\nthe landscape, observe the terrain and trees\nas you drive Boulder Field Road. The\nboundary is at Hickory Run Lake on the\nway to Boulder Field.\nThe eastern side of the park did not\nescape the melting glacial water. Before the\nglacier, Hawk Run and Mud Run probably\ngently flowed together. But, Hawk Run\ndrains the highlands of the unglaciated side\nof the park. Mud Run drains glaciated land\nfrom east of the park. The floodwaters from\nthe melting glacier eroded Mud Run quicker\nthan Hawk Run, creating the spectacular\nwaterfall, Hawk Falls.\nThe habitats of the glaciated side of the\npark are characterized by sphagnum moss\nbogs, evergreen trees and thin, moist soil.\nBlackburnian warbler, red-breasted nuthatch\nand northern waterthrush are common\nto this habitat. In the spring, spotted and\nJefferson salamanders and wood frogs\nmigrate to the bogs to breed.\nThe habitats of the unglaciated side of\nthe park are characterized by beech and\nchestnut oak trees on predominantly flat\nland. American redstart, red-eyed vireo and\nscarlet tanager are common to this habitat.\nAt the campground, that straddles the two\nareas, you can hear six species of thrush—\nAmerican robin, wood thrush, hermit\nthrush, Swainson’s thrush, veery and eastern\nbluebird.\nIn early May, before any trees have\nleaves, the serviceberry trees flower. In midJune,\nthe plentiful mountain laurel blooms,\nfollowed in late June to early July by the\nrhododendron.

A state park natural\narea is an area within a state park of unique\nscenic, geologic or ecological value that\nwill be maintained in a natural condition by\nallowing physical and biological processes\nto operate, usually without direct human\nintervention. These areas are set aside to\nprovide locations for scientific observation\nof natural systems, to protect examples\nof typical and unique plant and animal\ncommunities and to protect outstanding\nexamples of natural interest and beauty.\nBoulder Field: This rocky landscape is a\nNational Natural Landmark and state park\nnatural area. Boulder Field appears striking\nbecause of its flatness and the absence of\nvegetation over the large area of 400 feet by\n1,800 feet. Some of the boulders are 26 feet\nlong.\nMud Swamp: This remote, emergent\nwetland is dominated by spruce trees and is\na good example of a habitat more common\nin boreal areas.\nMud Run: This remote, nearly pristine\nmountain stream is lined with rhododendron\nand eastern hemlock.

An observation tower allows visitors to look out over the NEW Zoo, which is located within the Reforestation Camp. Picnicking and fishing around the Camp's many small ponds are popular summer activities. For the outdoor enthusiast, miles of scenic trails running throughout the Camp provide the opportunity for hiking, biking, and horseback riding. A playground and two rental shelter buildings are available for family gatherings and company events. In the winter months, the Reforestation Camp is a favorite winter recreation area with its miles of groomed cross-country ski and snowmobile trails. Each autumn hunters take advantage of the Brown County Rifle Range, located in the northeast portion of the Camp, to sight-in their firearms. Assistance and spotters are provided on this excellent 100-yard range. \n	Probably the best mushroom habitat in the Green Bay area, the place is mostly undisturbed and is made up of ash swamp, red pine, maple stands, sandy areas, ponds, streams, alder thickets, cedar and even patches of sweet fern.	One of the more interesting finds here is what I call the tennis ball or peach ball puffball. Yellow/peachy in color at first glance it is the color and size of a tennis ball. Otherwise in comparison to surrounding areas the diversity of fungi is amazing. I usually crawl at a pace of .6 mph when here because I can literally finally 40 species of fungi in a 20 foot radius in the summer.	Bring bug spray. Winter bracket fungus are good finds, however be wary of cross country skiers if you are on snowshoes.

1366	9929	1		Ranomafana (which means “hot water” in Malagasy) is doubtless one the most spectacular National Parks of Madagascar. Due to the good access and suitable location near the RN7, great biodiversity (12 lemur species are found here) and developed infrastructures, it has become one of the most visited places of the island. Established in 1991, it expands over a mountainous terrain of 415 km² totally covered by dense moist primary and secondary forest area. In 1986 the critically endangered golden bamboo lemur was discovered here by Dr. Patricia Wright, a fact that definitely pushed the government to create a national park. \n\n	Ranomafana National Park is on the edge of Madagascar’s High Plateau; it is extremely mountainous, with elevations ranging from 500 meters to 1,500 meters. The steepness of the slopes had preserved the park from exploitation before 1986. The range of altitudes allows for many different forest types, from lowland rainforest to cloud forest and high plateau forest. The park is divided into a core protected zone of 41,500 hectares surrounded by a peripheral zone in which some exploitation of the forest is permitted.	Fungal diversity is relatively unknown.	Ranomafana National Park is very easy to access. It lies about 60 km north from Fianarantsoa, and 400 south from Tana.There are two tarred roads which actually cross the Park: the RN25 from Ambohimasoa and the RN45 from Alakamisy. Both of them are practicable all year around, although it can take longer during the rainy season.\n\nThere is also a good taxi-brousse connection until Ranomafana village from Antananarivo and from Fianarantsoa.\n\nThe entry costs Ar 25,000 for one day visit and Ar 37,000 for two days. The fees for the circuits depend on the number of participants and the duration of the trek. Average is 50,000 to 80,000 Ar a day for one to five people.	http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/centre-valbio/about_us/ranomafana.html\n\nhttp://www.travelmadagascar.org/PARKS/Ranomafana-National-Park.html

1371	11854	1		"Santa Catalina Island, often called Catalina Island, or just Catalina, is a rocky island off the coast of the U.S. state of California in the Gulf of Santa Catalina. The island is 22 miles (35 km) long and 8 miles (13 km) across at its greatest width. The island is located about 22 miles (35 km) south-southwest of Los Angeles, California. The highest point on the island is 2,097 feet (639 m) Mt. Orizaba. Santa Catalina is part of the Channel Islands of California archipelago and lies within Los Angeles County."\n\n"Catalina is primarily composed of two distinct rock units: Catalina Schist from the Early Cretaceous (95 to 109 million years ago), and Miocene volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks. The island is rich in quartz, to the extent that some beaches on the seaward side have silvery-grey sand.[18] These formations originally occurred on the ocean floor and emerged from the ocean through tectonic activity. This means that the Santa Catalina Island land-mass was never directly connected to mainland California. Other geologic factors that contributed to the island topography observed today include further geologic uplift and subsidence, tectonic plate movement, sedimentation, metamorphic activity, weathering, and erosion.[19]"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catalina_Island,_California	USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 10b\n\n"Many millions of years ago, the formation of the island began with volcanic activity on the ocean floor. Subsequent geologic uplifting and subsidence, tectonic plate movement, sedimentation and metamorphic activity along with weathering, erosion and climatic change all worked together and played off each to create the topography of Santa Catalina Island as we know it today. The rugged mountains, shallow soils and arid climate that influence today's plant and animal life are only a small part of the island's natural history. \t\t\n\t\t\nThis offshore land-mass was originally devoid of terrestrial life. Miles of open ocean presented a salty, wet barrier to potential colonizers living on the mainland. They arrived on the island by chance; blown on the wind, bobbing and drifting on the waves, or carried by wing. Those plants and animals met the first challenge of just getting to Santa Catalina Island, but they and their offspring had equal challenges in surviving and reproducing on the new land.See a list of the Island’s endemic species (those found only on Catalina) by clicking here.\n\nToday, the island ecosystem includes a unique variety of native trees, shrubs, wildflowers, grasses, ferns, mammals, insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fungi, lichens, and other forms of life. Some are found only on Santa Catalina Island, while others are widespread. They all participate in a complex web of biological and physical interactions and processes.\n\nMaintaining the health of these species by preserving and restoring the habitats they need to survive and by allowing ecological processes to function without major human intervention is a primary component of the Conservancy's mission. The Island Ecology section summarizes what we know about island species and ecological processes, how they are related, what their threats are, and how we can best manage for their long-term survival."\nSource: http://www.catalinaconservancy.org/index.php?s=wildlife&p=catalina_ecology	Fungi have barely been documented or studied here.

1380	12074	1	Public	The Rock Lake Trail is managed primarily as a classic style cross country ski trail. As of the fall of 2003 the majority of this trail is closed to mountain bike use. See the CAMBA Rock Lake Bike Trail for bike use in this area.During the winter, updates on the condition of this trail can be found at the Cross Country Ski Report. Trail Length: 2 Km, 4 Km, 7.1 Km, 11.5 Km, 16 Km, and Rock Lake Loop which adds 1.8 Km to the 11.5 and 16 Km trails. What to Expect: The Rock Lake Trail is a narrow classic only ski trail that traverses rolling to hilly terrain. This trail is suitable for intermediate and advanced skiers. When snow depths permits, the trail is groomed and track is set. Downhills are long and twisting but have good run outs. The two longest loops pass a number of small scenic lakes. The trail is located in a maple and oak forest that has occassional stands of large white pine. Uphills are relatively short but numerous giving the skier a good workout. Forest Road 207 is a snowmobile trail in the winter. Hiking on the Rock Lake Trail is best in the short segments between Forest Road 207 and the lakes - Rock Lake, Frels and Hildebrand Lakes or spring Lake.	Secondary old growth forest with lots of downed logs and wood. Nice duff layer.	Even in dry times, species diverse.	This area is very confusing and is easy to get lost. This is in part due to poor signage and poor maps. Each user group has their own series of maps and none of them give recognition to the other user groups trails. Hence, if you are a foot traveler, do not be deceived by mountain bike trails. Bring a gps and a camera. The most useful map is one that you may possibly encounter on the trail which shows both bike trails and hiking trails. Take a photo of this immediately and definitely use it as a resource. Also watch out for old logging roads.\n\nA perfect example of this is when you enter the foot trail to Rock Lake. There is a sign that reads Rock Lake .4 miles. right by the road. 25 feet after the sign the trail branches into one well worn trail going down and one not so worn trail going uphill. Heading to a lake, you'd think you want to go downhill, but this trail will only lead you back to the road and in the opposite direction of the lake, as both trails make left and right turns about 100 yards in in the opposite direction.\n\nAnother example is that some signs posted by the forest service appear from your vehicle to be maps of the area, but upon closer inspection turn out to be just a map of their Semiprimitive Wilderness designation, with no trails indicated on the map whatsoever. It begs the question, why even put this map up at all.	
1382	12254	1		Red Bridge Campground is located just off the Mountain Loop Highway along the pebble-strewn bank of the South Fork Stillaguamish River in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Red Bridge Campground is a beautiful camp, offering visitors access to fishing, kayaking and hiking opportunities.\n\n	Rugged peaks, scenic rivers and abundant wildlife define the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas. On a clear day visitors can see Mt. Baker, which rises to an elevation of 10,781 feet. The active volcano is perpetually snow-capped. Mt. Baker's summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.\n\nOld-growth forests line the wide, gently-flowing South Fork Stillaguamish River, known for its salmon run. Chinook, Coho, chum, pink and sockeye salmon, steelhead trout, sea-run cutthroat and bull trout use the river and its tributaries for spawning.\n\nUndeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests provide important habitat for wildlife. Many species of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles make their homes in the area, which also sustains rare species such as lynx, moose, wolves and wolverine.		GPS Info.

Founded in 1976 and covering 108 square kilometres (42 sq mi), it is one of the 30 areas which are officially under protection in the country.\n\nThe park covers the Arrábida Hills, the Mediterranean-like vegetation and microclimate of which resemble Adriatic locations such as Dalmatia. The highest point in the park is the Serra da Arrábida at an elevation of 499 metres (1,637 ft). Two of the park's beaches—Portinho da Arrábida and Figueirinha—are popular among the inhabitants of Lisbon and Setúbal. Overlooking the two beaches is the Convento de Nossa Senhora da Arrábida (Convent of Our Lady of Arrábida), a former monastery established in the 16th century, managed today by the Fundação Oriente	Flora\nIn this area there is a lot of vegetation, that means the people want to care for the trees. Not only the people from Portugal also from the outside (people from other countries). And the aquatic fauna also has to have with the ecology of the area.\n\nFauna\nOf special relevance, the value of the maritime fauna on all over the park, like for example the Pedra da Anicha.

The reserve lies within the Andean Chocó bioregion, one of the most biodiverse habitats on the planet (Gentry 1992). The reserve protects approximately 6800 hectares of forest, approximately 80 percent of which is primary, premontane tropical wet and cloud forest. The Reserve also shares a border with the 305,000 hectare government-protected Cotocachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve. Rainfall averages 2903 ` 186 mm per year (Policha 2014). Humidity is typically high (~100%), and daily temperatures at the site range from 15°C to 25°C (Policha 2014). Seasonal variation in climate is minimal. 		This is a private reserve, and permits are needed for work, collection, and/or export of specimens, as well as transport across state lines within Ecuador.

1443	14590	1		One the shore of lake michigan south of Kewaunee, WI	Two Creeks Buried Forest provides a unique, precise record of the multiple glacial advances and retreats in this area during the Wisconsinan stage of glaciation. The historic forest became established between the Cary and Valders glacial substages. After temperatures warmed and the Cary glacier retreated northward, a mature boreal-like forest of black and white spruce, hemlock, pine, various mosses and other plants developed in the Two Creeks area near Lake Michigan. Shortly afterwards, the advancing Valders glacier blocked off the northern Lake Michigan drainageway, raising lake levels, flooding the forest and covering the ground with silt and clay, preventing decomposition. Later, when the southern end of the Valders glacier reached the area, it flattened the forest leaving behind another clay layer imbedded with logs and other debris. These layers of clay, silt, sand and the buried forest are visible on a steep bluff along the lakeshore where wave action and erosion have exposed the layers which contain long-buried branches, logs, and stumps of spruce, pine and hemlock trees. Conifer needles, cones, mosses, and terrestrial snails are also present within the layers. Unearthed wood, radiocarbon-dated at 11,850 before present, provides an absolute date on late-glacial sequences in the Lake Michigan Basin, and evidence that periods between substage glacial advances were long enough for forests to develop. Two Creeks Buried Forest is a unit of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve and has been a popular study site for North American geologists, botanists, glacial ecologists and climatologists. Removal of any material is strictly prohibited. Two Creeks Buried Forest is owned by the DNR and was designated a State Natural Area in 1967.

1507	22408	5		This area was set aside a while ago, and is being turned into the public area, but the status of the future park is not clear yet. On some maps it appears as a State Park, but there is no signs of the State Park on the ground yet. Some land is federal, and some is owned by the state. There are indicators that the area will be an Ice Age Reserve. Presently, the Ice Age Trail is being put through the area.	The significance of this parcel of land is it's situated right on the border between glaciated and "driftless" (unglaciated) areas of Wisconsin. This is precisely where the glacier stopped tens of thousands of 2years ago, before retreating northward.	Can contain species associated both with glaciated and unglaciated areas	Area still being developed into public-access park, but there are couple of rustic trails as well as a board with updates on the plans to add features and such.	http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/crossplains/

1510	2315	5		Located along the most picturesque part of Wisconsin River, with large stretch of the riverbank protected along this property. Beautiful oasis of calm in the very busy tourist area around Wisconsin Dells.	Word "Dells" comes from the French word "Dalles", which means river rapids in the deep gorge. The gorge is made of Cambrian Sandstone that is over 500 million years old, and Wisconsin River rushes through it, creating canyons 100 feet deep or more.	The area offers variety of exposures and habitats, from deep canyons with water seeping through  the rock to an upland dry forests. Lichens and mushrooms thrive here. Plants of note include Cliff cudweed (Pseudognaphalium saxicola) which is found at only tow places on earth - here and at Kickapoo River Valley.	Several scattered access points, very few developed trails to preserve the pristine beauty of the place. See reference below for the places to park. No parking fees.	http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/lands/naturalareas/index.asp?sna=283

1515	6236	4	MDC					
1516	6236	4	MDC	University Forest Conservation Area is in Wayne and Butler counties. The area is located near the south side of Lake Wappapello and is approximately 10 miles north of Poplar Bluff. Visitors can acess the area from Routes W, KK, and T in Butler County and Highway 172 and Route W in Wayne County.\n  This 7,149-acre area was originally endowed to the University of Missouri by the federal government as part of the Agriculture College Act of 1862. The School of Forestry, Fisheries and Wildlife took responsibility for the area in the early 1900s and in 1946 began managing the area for research and as a forestry summer camp. The Conservation Department acquired the area in 1988 for the purposes of continuing forest research, creating forest products, woodland related recreation opportunities for the public, and to demonstrate the effects of forest management.	The area primarily consists of oak-hickory forest with a scattering of shortleaf pine forest. Tree species include black oak, scarlet oak, hickory, maple, and dogwood. The forest provides habitat for deer, turkey, pileated woodpeckers, squirrels, and other typical Ozark wildlife. 			
1517	15858	5		Narrow strip of prairies and sand dunes along the Lake Michigan just south of Kenosha, WI and just north of Illinois border.	Majority of parcels are covered by different types of prairie. Northern part is called Kenosha Sand Dunes.	Sand dunes and forested areas in between are interesting from the standpoint of mushrooms and lichens.	The parcels of prairies and dunes are scattered among residential blocks, and are intermixed with them. Multiple small parking areas are available along the road. Access to dunes is from Kenosha's Southport Park just north of the parcel. Chiwaukee Prairie is recognized as National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.	https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/wisconsin/placesweprotect/chiwaukee-prairie.xml\n\nhttp://dnr.wi.gov/topic/lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=54\n\nhttp://www.chiwaukee.org/about/
1518	15832	5		Parcel of deep woods in the busy Milwaukee County, WI. 	Tow forest types - upland and lowland - separated by a small creek. Unusual species include American Beech which is out of its range here.	Lots of fallen tree logs and rotting wood creates many opportunities for mushrooms and other fungi.	Free access.

1519	11542	5		Small local natural landmark hidden in a plain sight along the rural road in Sauk County, WI	The landmark is part of the sandstone outcrop along the road. Sandstone boulders have both southern and northern exposure.	The sandstone boulders and outcrops harbor pretty rich lichen flora, including some unusual stuff.	Watch for the small sign on the pole along the road to spot the location.	
1520	2305	5		Southcentral Wisconsin. Located in the middle of Baraboo Hills.	Baraboo Range is composed of Baraboo quartzite and believed to be 1.6 billion years old - some of the oldest rocks in America. Having been on the bottom of the sea, with former sandstone metamorphosed into quartzite, the area eventually heaved upwards forming 500-foot bluffs. The lake was created when the glacier moraine blocked the river flow, trapping the water behind. 	The park is an Ice Age Reserve and hosts tremendous number of rare species of plants and animals. Various environments, including but not limited to cool canyons and exposed sun-backed cliffs harbor wildlife not typical for this latitude. 	The park is the third oldest State Park in Wisconsin. It's visited by more than a million people every year, yet has corners where you can get lost for few hours. Wisconsin Parking sticker is required.	http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/devilslake/history.html

1540	16829	4	USDA Forest Service	bq. Located 70 miles southeast of Portland and 65 miles east of Salem, the 36,731 acre Bull of the Woods Wilderness is relatively isolated. Steep ridges are deeply cut by a number of streams including the headwaters of the Collawash, Breitenbush, and Little North Santiam Rivers. The slopes of the numerous peaks are steep, with lower inclines ranging from 30 to 60 degrees and upper inclines from 60 to 90 degrees.\nVegetation changes from old-growth Douglas-fir/western hemlock to sparse sub-alpine forests. About a dozen lakes provide opportunities for fishing. The lakes are scattered throughout the Wilderness, accessible by trail but separated by high ridges. \nAt 5,523 feet, Bull of the Woods Peak marks the hub of a relatively challenging 75-mile trail system, with several longer or shorter loop opportunities. A historic fire lookout at the summit on Bull of the Woods Peak provides a view of the surrounding area on a clear day.  Traveling through this area you may come across relics of past mining activity from as early as the 1880’s. \n\nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mthood/recarea/?recid=79435#bullaccess

1546	17349	4	WI DNR Website	In Oconto Co., approximately 2 miles East of Mountain, WI.  The SNA encompasses about 1000 acres, North and South of County Highway W where it crosses Baldwin Creek.	Primarily mixed conifer-hardwood forest (oak, maple, pine), with areas of exposed igneous bedrock and associated talus slopes.	The site contains a diverse lichen and bryophyte flora, as well as many uncommon/rare plants, such as Purple Clematis, Indian Cucumber Root, and White Adders Mouth.	The entire 1006 acres is open to public use, and is entirely within the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest.  	Developed access to this site is fairly primitive.  The primary areas of the exposed bedrock are immediately north and south of CTH W, east of Baldwin Cr.  A minimally-developed trail exists that can be accessed from Bear Paw Rd., approximately 1 mile east of CTH W.  From here, the trail heads in a northerly direction, through one area of exposed bedrock, crosses CTH W, and leads you to another area of exposed bedrock.  It is also possible to access the site from the north, from Sunrise Lake Rd., using a primitive road just W of Macauley Creek.
1547	17357	1		Located off Greek Cemetery rd, Eleanor, Alabama. 	Subtropical, pine plantation, oak hammocks.  Borders pasture land. 	White rot seemed prevalent on a large percentage of the white oaks. Inonotus are common.	This is a public location,  foot traffic only. Locals will investigate anyone who stops on Greek Cemetery rd. This is due to someone listing the pastures as a good cubensis spot.

1549	17352	5		In NW Jefferson Co., WI, roughly 2 mi. due SW from downtown Lake Mills.	Aside from the lake itself, the majority of the habitat consists of tamarack and shrub swamp, with a few upland "islands" of oak-dominated hardwoods. The swampy areas are noted for having a particularly abundant population of poison sumac.  Also, the swamp becomes very quicksand-like near the edge of the lake, so tread with caution.  A nearly buried boat trailer at the end of the trail by the lakeshore serves as a warning to all.		This area is state-owned land, a designated natural area.  A parking area exists at the dead-end of Bean Lake Rd.  From there, a trail heads north, then east, to a very primitive "landing" on the west lakeshore.  Near the lakeshore, another trail branches off to the north, across the top of an "island" of upland hardwoods.  A second, less-used trail also starts at the parking area, heading east, and leading to the swamp, SW of the lake.\n\nThe upland hardwood islands on the northeast side of the lake are an archaeological site (Bean Lake Islands Archaeological District).  The prominent feature is a series of concentric trenches dug out by Native Americans.  While the trenches are still noticeable, the average person without any prior knowledge would likely not recognize anything out of the ordinary.  Attempting to visit these islands when the ground is not frozen is not recommended.	http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=111

There is a parking lot just off of County Highway G on Zimmer Rd. from where one can walk N to get to the northwestern most tract. The hemlocks are tall, the forest canopy closed, with very little growth in the understory – the forest is completely traversable – and a greater diversity of mushrooms than I have ever seen at once. It was difficult to walk without stepping on a giant Russula or Amanita, or some other coral, hydnoid, or boletoid mushroom. It was one of the most beautiful forests I have seen. The collection of edible fungi is allowed on Wisconsin State Natural Area land.	Wisconsin DNR: "Enterprise Hemlocks State Natural Area":https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=608

1566	5808	1		Tyrone is a town located in West Central Georgia about 30 miles southwest of Atlanta in northwestern Fayette County. It is bordered by Sharpsburg to the west, Palmetto to the northwest, Fairburn to the north, Fayetteville to the east, and Peachtree city to the south.\n\nIt is located in the headwaters of the Flint River Basin. The western border of the town (and Fayette County) is Line Creek, and Flat Creek flows through central Tyrone. 	The climate is a subtropical humid climate with warm humid summers and mild winters. \n\nThe soils are generally the heavy clay typical of much of the state of Georgia.\n\nThe predominate tree cover is Loblolly Pine, with many species of Oak, Red Maple, Sweetgum, Dogwoods, and Tulip Poplar making up the bulk of the remainder.\n\nMuch of the landscape is suburban or rural, as Tyrone is largely a commuter town based around the southern Atlanta metropolitan area's Healthcare system and Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. However, film production is ramping up as of the late 2010s, with many areas on the Northside dedicated to the metro Atlanta film industry.

1627	19569	1		The *United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF)* was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 350 on 31 May 1974, to implement Resolution 338 (1973) which called for an immediate ceasefire and implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242.\n\nThe resolution was passed on the same day the Agreement on Disengagement was signed between Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights, finally establishing a ceasefire to end the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\n\nThe Force has since performed its functions with the full cooperation of both sides. The mandate of UNDOF has been renewed every six months since 1974 (most recently until 31 December 2018). UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organization) and UNDOF are operating in the zone and continue to supervise the ceasefire. Before the Syrian Civil War, the situation in the Israel-Syria ceasefire line had remained quiet and there had been no serious incidents.\n\nDuring the *Syrian Civil War*, the buffer zone between Israeli and Syrian forces became a scene of the Quneitra clashes, forcing many UN observer forces to reconsider their mission due to safety issues. The fighting between Syrian Army and Syrian Opposition came to international attention when on March 2013, the al-Qaeda affiliated group Al-Nusra Front took hostage 21 Fijian UN personnel, who had been a part of the UN Disengagement Observer Force in the neutral buffer zone between Syria and Israeli-occupied territory. According to a UN official, they were taken hostage near Observation Post 58, which had sustained damage and was evacuated the previous weekend, following heavy combat in close proximity at Al Jamla. The UN personnel were later released with Jordanian mediation.\n\nSource:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Disengagement_Observer_Force

It's lower bound is the Isinglass River	This area was farmland in the early 20th century and has overgrown to mixed conifer and deciduous forest along the banks of the Isinglass River, hard by the Turnkey Landfill.  It provides a variety of terrain from bog to upland.  Several public trails provide easy access.  As the river name implies, there is abundant mica in the granite bedrock which underlies it.  There are many mature and senescent Hemlock and White Pine standing over a maturing hardwood forest.  At the lowest level in the shade of the hardwoods, small white pine are growing which will form the climax forest in a century or so.  Temperatures average below freezing in winter with the first frost from late September to mid October.  It is fairly similar to the College Woods area in Durham, except it sits next to a landfill instead of a university.  The reader is invited draw his or her own conclusions as to which is better.	There are interesting coral mushrooms and Clavinopulis to be found.

1668	22090	5	RW Rockwell	Location is at 1400 feet elevation at the base of forested, north-facing slopes, along the south side of the Trinity River and includes a seasonal creek.	Climate includes dry and hot summers (to 105oF and prone to drought), with cool, wet, foggy winters that occasionally provide heavy rains, heavy wet snow and/or low temperatures into the teens (oF).  A land of seasonal climate extremes, positioned near the southern border of the Trinity Alps Wilderness between the Sacramento Valley at Redding and the California coast at Arcata/Eureka.  The position of this property provides some evening temperature moderation during hot summer months from downslope and river influences (hence the presence of isolated, island populations of plant species such as Western Red Cedar, ferns, and Fawn Lily).\n\nContiguous property and public forest includes a mix of Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar, Ponderosa Pine, Jeffrey Pine, Sugar Pine, Gray Pine, Oregon White Oak, Black Oak, Madrone, Big Leaf Maple, and Pacific Dogwood, with floor vegetation including four species of fern, gooseberry, black cap raspberry, service berry, California grape, two Ceanothus species, poison oak, two manzanita species and mixed native grass and wildflower species. Note that lush ground vegetation on this property burned intensely during the 2017 Helena Fire, killing half the trees in this location (which have since been felled and removed).  Seedlings of fire-killed native tree and shrub species (e.g. pines, firs, cedar and manzanita) have re-established post-fire, while species such as Madrone, poison oak, Ceanothus, ferns and wildflowers are also regenerating from roots.

1686	3949	1		Auburn is located at 38°53′55″N 121°04′28″W.[16]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 7.2 square miles (19 km2), of which 0.03 square miles (0.078 km2), or 0.38%, is water.\n\nAuburn is situated in the Northern California foothills of the Sierra Nevada range, approximately 800 vertical feet above the confluence of the North Fork and Middle Fork of the American River. It is located between Sacramento and Reno, Nevada along Interstate 80. Mountainous wilderness canyons and the western slope of the Sierra Nevada lie adjacent eastward, while gentle rolling foothills well-suited for agriculture lie to the west. The crest of the Sierra Nevada lies approximately 45 miles (72 km) eastward, and the Central Valley lies approximately ten miles to the west.	Auburn has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa) that is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. Average December temperatures are a maximum of 54.4 °F (12.4 °C) and a minimum of 39 °F (4 °C). Average July temperatures are a maximum of 94.0 °F (34.4 °C) and a minimum of 61.0 °F (16.1 °C). Annually, there are an average of 59.4 days with highs of 90 °F (32 °C) or higher, an average of 7.0 days with 100 °F (38 °C) or higher, and an average of 17.1 days with 32 °F (0 °C) or lower.[17] The record high temperature was 113 °F (45 °C) on July 15, 1972. The record low temperature was 16 °F (−9 °C) on December 9, 1972 and December 7, 2009.[17]\n\nAverage annual precipitation is 37.36 inches (949 mm). There are an average of 70 days with measurable precipitation. The wettest year was 1983 with 64.87 inches (1,648 mm) and the driest year was 1976 with 11.76 inches (299 mm). The most precipitation in one month was 23.08 inches (586 mm) in January 1909. The most precipitation in 24 hours was 5.41 inches (137 mm) on October 13, 1962,[17] during the Columbus Day Storm. Snow rarely falls in Auburn; average annual snowfall is only 0.0–1.0 inch (0–25 mm).[17] The most snowfall in one year was 10.7 inches (270 mm) in 1972, including 6.5 inches (170 mm) in January 1972.[18]\n\nAuburn's Köppen classification and climate similarities to locations such as Napa, California and parts of Italy make it a suitable region for growing wine grapes. Auburn and the surrounding areas of Placer County are home to over 20 wineries.[19]

1689	24145	1		Cer (pronounced [tsɛr]) is a mountain in western Serbia, 30 kilometers from Šabac, 100 kilometers west of Belgrade. The highest peak has an elevation of 689 m (2,260 ft) above sea level. Cer is rich in the Turkey oak forests after which it was named.				
1690	16749	1		Mountain Medvednik is located near the town of Valjevo (30km) and 1247 meters above sea level. It is situated in the center of the mountain range which starts near the Drina river and spreads to the west, ending in the vicinity of Belgrade.\nMountain range which Medvednik is part off, starts with Gučevo in the west, and accross Boranja, Jagodnja and Sokolska planina continues to Valjevo mountains, consisting off Medvednik (1247 m above sea level), Jablanik (1274 m above sea level), Povlen (highest peak at 1347 m above sea level), Maljen (Kraljev sto, 1104 m above sea level), and ends with Suvobor and Rajac in the east.\n\nMedvednik got its name from the fact that this mountain from the Valjevo side is seen as a big bear that is lying down to rest. Others claim that the mountain got its name from a large number of bears that were present here, but hunted heavily which caused local extinction.	In a series of Valjevo mountains, Medvednik is the most striking mountain from a distance, with its asymmetrical silhouette that rises slightly from the east to a plateau in the middle of the massif, to suddenly collapse with steep limestone cliffs at its western end. As the last mountain in the range, its peaks in the highest part exceed 1200 meters above sea level.\n\nThe slopes are densely overgrown with beech forest , with good yields of mushrooms, and meadows with wild strawberries and medicinal herbs. Beech forest is thinning, while artificially introduced pine appears, and in the lower parts, cultural areas under raspberry and blackberry plantations are easily visible, which has a significant share in the income of the local population. The northern slopes are leaning from the east on the very close mountain Jablanik and the undulating plateaus of the upper basin of the river Jablanica.

1694	21696	1		Leeward slopes of the Koolau Mountains near the urban center of Honolulu, Hawaii. \n	Humidity and rainfall increase with elevation. Nuuanu Valley receives as much as 160" of rain a year. Subtropical Moist Forest is present at lower elevations, grading to Subtropical Montaine Rain Forest at higher elevations. Average humidity is 75% and average temperature is 75 F.\n\nGeologically, Nuuanu Valley is a part of the flank of the Koolau Shield volcano. Bedrock is comprised exclusively of shield building basalt. The valley formed through extensive erosion of the volcano after activity ceased. Tropical soils and paleosols are present primarily as valley fill and along the tops of ridges.\n\nAs with much of the Hawaiian Islands, introduction of invasive non-native species has dramatically altered the forest ecology of Nuuanu Valley. Little remains of the natural habitat. At elevation there are still some stands of primarily native vegetation. These locations are difficult to access and require advanced hiking ability.\n\nNuuanu Valley is heavily developed at lower elevations, and is part of urban Honolulu. Only the uppermost elevations and steeper terrain is undisturbed.		Much of the undeveloped portion of Nuuanu Valley sits within the Honolulu Forest Watershed Reserve. And is publicly accessible. Numerous trails are available for hiking and are mapped.
